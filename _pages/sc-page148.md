- And all the morbid share;â€”so heaven will bless,
- With manifold encrease, thy costly care.

- SUFFICE not this; to every slave assign [445]
- Some mountain-ground: or, if waste broken land
- To thee belong, that broken land divide.
- This let them cultivate, one day, each week;[^f148n1]
- And there raise yams,[^f148n2] and there cassada's root:[^f148n3]
- From a good daemon's staff cassada sprang, [450]
- Tradition says, and Caribbees believe;
- Which into three the white-rob'd genius broke,
- And bade them plant, their hunger to repel.
- There let angola's bloomy bush[^f148n4] supply
- For many a year, with wholesome pulse their board. [455]
- There let the bonavist,[^f148n5] his fringed pods

> VER. 449. *cassada*\] To an antient Carribean, bemoaning the savage uncomfortable life of his countrymen, a deity clad in white apparel appeared, and told him, he would have come sooner to have taught him the ways of civil life, had he been addressed before. He then showed him sharp-cutting stones to fell trees and build houses; and bade him cover them with the palm leaves. Then he broke his staff in three; which, being planted, soon after produced cassada. See Ogilvy's America.[^f148n6]

> VER. 454. *angola*\] This is called *Pidgeon-pea*, and grows on a sturdy shrub, that will last for years. It is justly reckoned among the most wholesome legumens. The juice of the leaves, dropt into the eye, will remove incipient films. The botanic name is *Cytisus*.

> VER. 456. *bonavist*\] This is the Spanish name of a plant, which produces an excellent bean. It is a parasitical plant. There are five sorts of bonavist, the green, the white, the

[^f148n1]: Enslaved laborers were generally required to go to their provision grounds one day per week to tend them. In certain colonies, however, an internal marketing system gradually emerged that may have encouraged some to spend extra time cultivating their provision grounds. For instance, in Jamaica, those who participated in the system were able to sell or trade their provisions for other goods and currency. They were also able to supplement the inadequate diet provided to them by planters, although those individuals who cultivated provision grounds did not enjoy, on average, better health or longer lifespans than those dependent primarily on imported rations. Still, the provision grounds did offer their cultivators some control over what they ate, as they were responsible for choosing what plants to cultivate, and, in limited cases, they also offered some degree of economic autonomy. They also laid the foundation for agricultural production in the British Caribbean in the years following emancipation. Eschewing the model of industrial agriculture represented by the plantation, the newly freed turned instead to small-scale farming.  

[^f148n2]: One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved persons in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as crucially, yams formed a part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Although there is one South American species of yam (*Dioscorea trifida*) that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, more important species to the diets of the enslaved were *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa, and *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century (Higman 72-81).  

[^f148n3]: Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era and subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well, although it was not as important a food source as the yam. Nevertheless, it still appeared in provision grounds because it is an easy crop to cultivate: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. These advantages offset cassava's toxic nature: its roots, which are the parts of the plant prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw roots are poisonous to human beings. The poison can be neutralized by proper processing, however: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads (Higman 61-69).  

[^f148n4]: Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that has historically been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of the enslaved because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

[^f148n5]: A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) whose native range includes the Cape Verde Islands, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.

[^f148n6]: John Ogilby's *America: being the latest, and most accurate description of the New World* (1671). Ogilby (1600-1676) was a Scottish publisher and geographer.
