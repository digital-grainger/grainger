- The task how difficult, to cull the best
- From thwarting sentiments; and best adorn
- What Wisdom chuses, in poetic garb!
- Yet, Inspiration, come: the theme unsung, [300]
- Whence never poet cropt one bloomy wreath;
- Its vast importance to my native land,
- Whose sweet idea rushes on my mind, 
- And makes me 'mid this paradise repine; 
- Urge me to pluck, from Fancy's soaring wing, [305]
- A plume to deck Experience' hoary brow.

- ATTEND.——The son of Time and Truth declares;
- Unless the low-hung clouds drop fatness down,
- No bunching plants of vivid green will spring,
- In goodly ranks, to fill the planter's eye. [310]
- Let then Sagacity, with curious ken,[^f24n1] 
- Remark the various signs of future rain.
- The signs of rain, the Mantuan Bard[^f24n2] hath sung
- In loftiest numbers; friendly to thy swains,
- Once fertile Italy: but other marks [315]
- Portend the approaching shower, in these hot climes.

- SHORT sudden rains, from Ocean's ruffled bed,
- Driven by some momentary squalls, will oft
- With frequent heavy bubbling drops, down-fall;

[^f24n1]: Range of vision.

[^f24n2]:  Virgil was born in the Italian provice of Mantua.
