- Defend thy stock from noon's inclement blaze, [260]
- And from night-dews; for night no respite knows.

- NOR, when their destin'd labour is perform'd,
- Be thou asham'd to lead the panting mules
- \(The muse, soft parent of each social grace,
- With eyes of love God's whole creation views\) [265]
- To the warm pen; where copious forage strowed,[^f101n1]

Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh a patent for all such land, from 33. to 40. N. lat. as he should chuse to settle with English, reserving only to the crown a fifth part of all the gold and silver which should therein be discovered, in lieu of all services. Accordingly several imbarkations were fitted out from England, but all to no purpose. Some farther attempts, however, were made to settle this part of the country in the succeeding reign; but it was not till the year 1620, that a regular form of government took place. Then was tobacco planted, and negroes imported into Virginia. Since that time it has gradually improved, and does not now contain fewer than 100,000 white people of better condition, besides twice as many servants and slaves. The best shingles come from Egg-Harbour.[^f101n4]
