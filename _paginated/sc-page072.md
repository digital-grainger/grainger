- Rushes the headlong sky; the city rocks;
- The good man throws him on the trembling ground;
- And dies the murderer in his inmost soul.—
- Sullen the West withdraws his eager storms.——
- Will not the tempest now his furies chain? [335]
- As, no! as when in Indian forests, wild,
- Barbaric armies suddenly retire
- After some furious onset, and, behind
- Vast rocks and trees, their horrid forms conceal,
- Brooding on slaughter, not repuls'd; for soon [340]
- Their growing yell the affrighted welkin rends,
- And bloodier carnage mows th' ensanguin'd plain:
- So the South, sallying from his iron caves
- With mightier force, renews the aerial war;
- Sleep, frighted, flies; and, see! yon lofty palm, [345]
- Fair nature's triumph, pride of Indian groves,
- Cleft by the sulphurous bolt! See yonder dome,
- Where grandeur with propriety combin'd,
- And Theodorus[^f72n1] with devotion dwelt;
- Involv'd in smouldering flames.—From every rock, [350]
- Dashes the turbid torrent; thro' each street
- A river foams, which sweeps, with untam'd might,
- Men, oxen, Cane-lands to the billowy main.—

[^f72n1]: Theodorus may be the Samian architect active c. 550–520 BCE.
