- HE spoke, and ere the swift-wing'd zumbadore[^f46n1]  
- The mountain-desert startl'd with his hum;  
- Ere fire-flies trimm'd their vital lamps; and ere  
- Dun Evening trod on rapid Twilight's heel: [645]  
- His knell was rung;——  
- And all the Cane-lands wept their father lost.  

- MUSE, yet awhile indulge my rapid course;  
- And I'll unharness, soon, the foaming steeds.  

- IF Jove descend, propitious to thy vows, [650]  
- In frequent floods of rain; successive crops  
- Of weeds will spring. Nor venture to repine,  
- Tho' oft their toil thy little gang renew;  
- Their toil tenfold the melting heavens repay:  
- For soon thy plants will magnitude acquire, [655]  

> VER. 642. *and ere the swift-wing'd zumbadore,*\] This bird, which is one of the largest and swiftest known, is only seen at night, or rather heard; for it makes a hideous humming noise (whence its name) on the desert tops of the Andes. See Ulloa's Voyage to South-America. It is also called *Condor*. Its wings, when expanded, have been known to exceed sixteen feet from tip to tip. See *Phil. Trans.* Nº 208.[^f46n2]  

> VER. 644. *Ere fire-flies*\] This surprising insect is frequent in Guadaloupe, *&c*. and all the warmer parts of America. There are none of them in the English Caribbee, or Virgin-Islands.[^f46n3]  

> VER. 645. *on rapid Twilight's heel:*\] There is little or no twilight in the West-Indies. All the year round it is dark before eight at night. The dawn is equally short.


[^f46n1]: Zumbadore means buzzer in Spanish. As Grainger explains in his note, he is referring to the Andean condor (*Vultur gryphus*).

[^f46n2]: *Philosophical Transactions*, the journal of the Royal Society.  

[^f46n3]: The Virgin Islands are a group of islands situated to the east of Puerto Rico and northwest of St. Kitts. Now divided into the British Virgin Islands and the US Virgin Islands.
