- Thick mantles o'er the boiling wave, do thou
- The skum that mantles carefully remove.

- Thy boiling-house be lofty: all atop
- Open, and pervious to the tropic breeze;
- Whose cool perflation,[^f105n3] wooed through many a grate, [340]
- Dispells the steam, and gives the lungs to play.

- THE skill'd in chemia, boast of modern arts,

- In many a plant that oil, and acid juice,
- And ropy mucilage,[^f105n5] by nature live: [345]
- These, envious, stop the much desir'd embrace
- Of the essential salts,[^f105n6] tho' coction bid
- The aqueous particles to mount in air.

- 'MONG salts essential, sugar wins the palm,
- For taste, for colour, and for various use: [350]

> VER. 339. *Open, and pervious*\] This also assists the christallization of the Sugar.
