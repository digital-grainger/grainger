- Thine age was spent solliciting the Prince,
- To whom thou gav'st the sceptre of that world. [120]
- Yet, blessed spirit, where inthron'd thou sit'st,
- Chief 'mid the friends of man, repine not thou:
- Dear to the Nine,[^f14n1] thy glory shall remain
- While winged Commerce either ocean ploughs;
- While its lov'd pole the magnet coyly shuns; [125]
- While weeps the guaiac, and while joints the Cane. 

- SHALL the Muse celebrate the dark deep mould,
- With clay or gravel mix'd?—This soil the Cane
- With partial fondness loves; and oft surveys
- Its progeny with wonder.—Such rich veins [130]
- Are plenteous scatter'd o'er the Sugar-isles:
- But chief that land, to which the bearded fig,[^f14n2]

> VER. 132. *the bearded Fig*\] This wonderful tree, by the Indians called the *Banian-tree*; and by the botanists *Ficus Indica*, or *Bengaliensis*, is exactly described by Q. Curtius,[^f14n3] and beautifully by Milton in the following lines:[^f14n4]

> "The Fig-tree, not that kind renown'd for fruit,  
> "But such as at this day to Indians known,  
> "In Malabar and Decan spreads her arms;[^f14n5]  
> "Branching so broad and long, that in the ground,  
> "The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow  
> "About the mother-tree, a pillar'd shade,  
> "High over-arch'd, and echoing walks between.  
> "There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,  
> "Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds  
> "At Loop-holes cut through thickest shade."—— 
{:.indented} 
      
> What year the Spaniards first discovered Barbadoes is not certainly known; this however is certain, that they never settled there, but only made use of it as a stock-island[^f14n6]

[^f14n1]: The nine muses of art, literature, and science.

[^f14n2]: *Ficus citrifolia*, also known as the wild banyan tree. It is the national tree of Barbados, and its native range includes Florida and the tropical Americas.  

[^f14n3]: Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century CE), Roman historian and author of *Histories of Alexander the Great*.

[^f14n4]: John Milton (1606-1674) was an English poet and polemicist. Especially known for *Paradise Lost* (1667) and *Samson Agonistes* (1671). Grainger quotes here from *Paradise Lost* (9.1101-1110).  

[^f14n5]: Malabar is a region on the southwest coast of India (modern Kerala). Decan refers to the Deccan plateau, immediately to the east of Kerala. 

[^f14n6]: Grainger means that the Spanish left livestock to breed in Barbados so that the island would supply them with provisions on future trips.
