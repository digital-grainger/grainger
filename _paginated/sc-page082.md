- THO' faster than the Tropic-bird[^f82n1] they flew,
- Oft Junio cried, ah! when shall we see land? [510]
- Soon land they made: and now in thought he claspt
- His Indian bride, and deem'd his toils o'erpaid.

- SHE, no less amorous, every evening walk'd
- On the cool margin of the purple main,
- Intent her Junio's vessel to descry. [515]

- ONE eve, (faint calms for many a day had rag'd,)
- The winged daemons of the tempest rose;
- Thunder, and rain, and lightning's awful power.
- She fled: could innocence, could beauty claim
- Exemption from the grave; the aethereal Bolt,[^f82n2] [520]
- That stretch'd her speechless, o'er her lovely head
- Had innocently roll'd.

- MEAN while, impatient Junio lept ashore,
- Regardless of the Daemons of the storm.
- Ah youth! what woes, too great for man to bear, [525]
- Are ready to burst on thee? Urge not so
- Thy flying courser.[^f82n3] Soon Theana's porch

> VER. 509. *Tropic-bird*\] The French call this bird Fregate, on account of its swift flying. It is only to be met with in the warm latitudes.

[^f82n1]: Although he uses the term tropic bird, Grainger means the frigate bird, which was famed for its wide wingspan and ability to remain airborne for weeks.  

[^f82n2]: Lightning. 

[^f82n3]: A swift horse, a racer.
