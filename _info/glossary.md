## Places  

- Antilles. The term Antilles refers to the islands of the Caribbean and is often used as a substitute for West Indies. The Greater Antilles are the large islands on the northwest end of the archipelago and include Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and Puerto Rico. The Lesser Antilles (further split into the Windward and Leeward Islands) are the islands ranging from the Virgin Islands in the north to Grenada in the south. St. Kitts is one of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.  

- Azores. Islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. Along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeiras islands, they often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.

- Barbary-coast. The Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that runs from modern Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean and includes parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.

- Basseterre. Basseterre is the capital of St. Kitts.

- Canary Islands. Islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. Along with the Azores, Cape Verde Islands, and the Madeiras, they often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.

- Cape-Verd Islands. Islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. Along with the Azores, the Canary Islands, and the Madeiras, they often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.

- East-Indies. The historical term for the whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.

- Enna. City and province in central Sicily.

- Guiana. The aggregate name for the colonies located along the northern coast of South America between the mouth of the Orinoco River (in modern Venezuela) and the mouth of the Amazon (in modern Brazil). Colonizers included Portugal, France, the Netherlands, England, and Spain.  

- Leeward Islands. Leeward is a nautical term meaning sheltered from the wind (i.e., downwind). The Leeward Islands include the British and US Virgin Islands, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barthélemy, Barbuda, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Dominica.  

- Jamaica. The island of Jamaica became an English colony in 1655. It gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1962. 

- Madeiras. Islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. Along with the Azores, the Canary and Cape Verde islands, and the Madeiras, they often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.

- Martinico. Spanish name for the island of Martinique, the northernmost of the Windward Islands. Now an overseas department of France.  

- Mount Misery. A name used by Europeans for the main volcanic mountain on St. Kitts. It was renamed Mt. Liamuiga when St. Kitts and Nevis became independent.  

- St. Christopher. The island of St. Christopher was known as Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. Columbus claimed it on behalf of Spain in 1493, and it was partitioned between the French and the English in the early seventeenth century, at which time it was primarily a tobacco colony. While the two countries exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was firmly under British control when Grainger left England in 1759 during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Grainger uses "St. Christopher," "Liamuiga," and "St. Kitts" interchangeably in the poem, but we have chosen to use "St. Kitts" on this site. St. Kitts has been part of the nation of St. Kitts and Nevis (also known as the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis) since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1983.  

- St. Domingo. Hispaniola.

- St. Jago de la Vega. The capital of Jamaica under Spanish colonial rule and then under English colonial rule until the late nineteenth century, also called Santiago de la Vega (the English renamed it "Spanish Town"). It lies just west of Kingston, the current capital of Jamaica.  

- Tempé. The name of a valley in Thessaly located between Mounts Olympus and Ossa; it also can be used as a general name for a beautiful valley or rural spot.  

- West-Indies. Historically, the West Indies is the region that includes the northern coast of South America, Central America, Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. We use the term Caribbean throughout this site to refer to the islands from Grenada through Cuba.

## Plants  

- Acajou. \(*Anacardium occidentale*\) Another name for the cashew or cashewnut tree. Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. The fruit is caustic and was supposedly used by women in the eighteenth-century Caribbean as a chemical peel to remove freckles (Riddell 82-83; also see Grainger's note in Book IV, p. 132).  

- Avocado. Grainger mentions two kinds of avocado in his note in Book I, p. 8: "the one bearing a green fruit, which is the most delicate, and the other a red, which is less esteemed, and grows chiefly in Mexico." There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.  

- Bearded fig. \(*Ficus citrifolia*\) Also known as the wild banyan tree, this fig is the national tree of Barbados, and its native range includes Florida and the tropical Americas.  

- Bermuda cedar. \(*Juniperus bermudiana*\) A species of cedar native to Bermuda that was used by early colonists as building material and fuel. By the 1830s, the ship-building industry had denuded Bermuda of most of its indigenous cedars. It is still a critically endangered species.  

- Bois d'anise. Anise wood. The leaves of some varieties of avocado give off a scent of anise when crushed.

- Carob tree. \(*Ceratonia siliqua*\) Also called the locust bean tree, the carob tree is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.  

- Cassia. Probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka.  

- Ceiba. \(*Ceiba pentandra*\) Also known as the kapok or silk-cotton tree, the ceiba, whose native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas, can achieve a height of fifty meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds. 

- Coffee. A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

- Cotton. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. 

- Forbidden fruit. The forbidden fruit refers to species of citrus that are now virtually extinct. It is similar in taste to the orange and the shaddock, and it is closely related to the grapefruit (Higman 180).   

- Guaiac. Either *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. It also was widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.  

- Guava. The guava is a fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, which is probably native to Central and South America but was naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.  

- Indigo. (genus *Indigofera*) A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, indigo is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye.

- Lady's-thighs. \(*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'\) A pear known today as the jargonelle pear, one of the oldest pears in cultivation.  

- Locust bean tree. \(*Ceratonia siliqua*\) Also called the carob tree, the locust bean tree is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.  

- Myrtle. \(*Myrtus communis*\) An aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love.

- Sabbaca. \(*Persea americana*\) A variety of avocado, which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Avocado was an important part of the diets of the enslaved who had access to it: they harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens (Higman 158-160).

- Shaddoc. \(*Citrus maxima*\) The shaddock, which Grainger spells as shaddoc, is a kind of citrus, also known as the pomelo or pummelo. It is native to Southeast Asia and became known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by an Englishman named Captain Shaddock.  

- Sugar cane. \(*Saccharum officinarum*\) The cane is most likely native to New Guinea, where it was first cultivated thousands of years ago and from where it began to be dispersed by human migrants around 8000 BCE. By the fourth to sixth centuries CE, sugar cane was being refined into crystallized sugar in India and Persia. From there, sugar cane and knowledge of sugar cultivation, processing, and refining traveled to the Mediterranean. The Spanish then transplanted sugar to the Americas and established plantations there (Columbus first brought sugar to the Caribbean in 1493).

- Tobacco. \(*Nicotiana tabacum*\) A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, and native to the Americas. 

- White cedar. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

- Wild red cedar. \(*Cedrela odorata*\) The red cedar is an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. It is now considered vulnerable to extinction due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.
