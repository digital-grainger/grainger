# Obeah

In Book 4, Grainger mentions "Obia-men" (379) and "Obia" (381), also commonly spelled in eighteenth-century texts as "obeah men" and "obeah." Although obeah increasingly became the preoccupation of authors writing about the Caribbean in the years following the publication of the first edition of *The Sugar-Cane* in 1764, what exactly obeah was--and how readers should interpret Grainger and others' references to it--remains a major question. 

The first definition of obeah in the *Oxford English Dictionary* reads, "Designating a person or thing involved in or associated with the practice of a kind of sorcery, witchcraft, or folk medicine originating in West Africa and mainly practised in the English-speaking areas of the Caribbean." While this definition provides a starting point for understanding obeah, it also obscures the fact that obeah was defined in print by European and colonial authors who, for the most part,  

Although descriptions of obeah appears in works about the Caribbean before 1760, it was not until the outbreak of Tacky's Revolt that year in Jamaica that obeah became a topic of pressing concern and interest to European and colonial authors. Tacky's Revolt was one of the most significant slave revolts in the eighteenth-century Caribbean. Named after Tacky, an African who was one of its principal leaders, the revolt broke out on 7 April 1760 and ended up inspiring other rebellious actions in Jamaica that extended until October of 1761. During this approximately eighteenth-month period, at least a thousand to fifteen hundred enslaved persons participated, and they killed approximately sixty whites and destroyed plantation property worth thousands of pounds. More than 500 black men and women were killed or executed or committed suicide, and 500 more were transported or exiled from Jamaica permanently.  
 
Because obeah practitioners--or obeah men, as they were commonly known--had played highly visible roles in Tacky's Revolt, the Jamaican legislature moved to quash obeah shortly after the revolt's outbreak. Tacky had planned the revolt with obeah practitioners, who were supposed to use their powers to prevent the rebels from being harmed by bullets. The obeah practitioners also had administered loyalty oaths in the form of potions made of blood, rum, and grave dirt. As a result, on 18 December 1760, the Jamaican legislature passed a law that outlawed the practice of obeah and threatened those who violated the law with either transportation or death.  

As a result of its new notoriety, obeah began appearing more and more in accounts of the Caribbean and indeed became a mainstay of texts seeking to represent it. These accounts also increasingly demonized the practice and became more and more lurid in their descriptions. Examples include...

These representations have contributed to fundamental misunderstandings of obeah, which is still associated today with concepts like black magic and voodoo or poisoning. See Diana Paton 2012 on poisoning and misunderstanding...and how poisoning was a way to demonize it--and at the same time to downplay the spiritual/supernatural powers of the obeah man. 

Obeah is actually more accurately described as a complex of religious and medical practices designed to alleviate some of the dangers and hardships of working and living on a plantation. Or as Brown defines it, "the catchall term used to describe a complex of shamanistic practices derived from various parts of Africa and conducted by ritual specialists working largely outside formal institutions" (Brown 145). Also, "herbalists" and "sages," versus conjurers (146). Obeah also referred to charms...comon ingredients were blood, feathers and other natural materials, broken glass, eggshells, dirt from grave sites (Brown 146). Moreover, it was probably primarily considered by obeah men, a name given to its practitioners, and other enslaved persons on the plantation as beneficial, as directing supernatural or spiritual forces for the benefit of human beings. This benefit could be defined in ways that were harmful to planters, however, so this was in part responsible for planters' hysterical reactions. One person's benefit could be the downfall of the master and the plantation, after all. 

Grainger's representation of obeah, excerpted below from Book IV, also portrays obeah in a negative way, yet interestingly, he makes no mention of Tacky's Revolt or the uses to which obeah could possibly be put against the masters/planters/plantation, even though he was writing in the near aftermath of Tacky's Revolt. Perhaps since Grainger was writing in the immediate aftermath of Tacky's Rebellion, he did not yet have access to the more demonizing discourse that would arise later. Indeed, it's interesting to think about Grainger's poem as being a kind of transitional text located between the later demonizing discourse and an earlier discourse about obeah. This earlier discourse represented obeah also in a negative fashion, but rather than implying the possibilities of rebellion, it was concerned with debunking obeah with conjuring or fake medicine. [Brown says that obeah was seen as a harmless if strange/superstitious practice before 1760] [Although saying it was superstition/fake is a way of excluding it from the realm of legitimate religious practice] This, too, was seen as harmful since it could result in the enslaved--and planters' labor force--being treated in deleterious ways. Nevertheless, it's important to remember that obeah men and the enslaved did actually have knowledge of local plants and how they could be used to alleviate complaints and illnesses. It's also important to remember that the rise of obeah and its flourishing as a religion and medical practice was enabled by the systematic neglect of the enslaved by planters, who rarely provided medical care on the plantations.

- In wrath, a conjurer's snake-mark'd staff hath struck! [370]

- They inly pine; all aliment reject;
- Or insufficient for nutrition take:
- Their features droop; a sickly yellowish hue
- Their skin deforms; their strength and beauty fly. [375]

- Whom drowth, convulsions, and whom death surround,
- Fatal attendants! if some subtle slave

- Of sable Africk trust:—Ye, sacred nine!

- Transpierce the gloom, which ignorance and fraud
- Have render'd awful; tell the laughing world [385]

> blacks imagine that its blow, if not mortal, will at least occasion long and troublesome disorders. A belief in magic is inseparable from human nature, but those nations are most addicted thereto, among whom learning, and of course, philosophy have least obtained. As in all other countries, so in Guinea, the conjurers, as they have more understanding, so are they almost always more wicked than the common herd of their deluded countrymen; and as the negroe-magicians can do mischief, so they can also do good on a plantation, provided they are kept by the white people in proper subordination.

- FERN root cut small, and tied with many a knot;
- Old teeth extracted from a white man's skull;
- A lizard's skeleton; a serpent's head:
- These mix'd with salt, and water from the spring, [390]
- Are in a phial pour'd; o'er these the leach
- Mutters strange jargon, and wild circles forms.

- OF this possest, each negroe deems himself
- Secure from poison; for to poison they
- Are infamously prone: and arm'd with this, [395]
- Their sable country daemons they defy,
- Who fearful haunt them at the midnight hour,
- To work them mischief. This, diseases fly;
- Diseases follow: such its wonderous power!
- This o'er the threshold of their cottage hung, [400]
- No thieves break in; or, if they dare to steal,
- Their feet in blotches, which admit no cure,
- Burst loathsome out: but should its owner filch,
- As slaves were ever of the pilfering kind,
- This from detection screens;—so conjurers swear. [405]
