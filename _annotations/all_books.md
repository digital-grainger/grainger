[plant] 20.237 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.   

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*) is native to tropical Africa. Although eaten in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, some believed that its taste was too watery and that it could cause stomach problems and even worms.  

[plant] 21.237n boiled or roasted. One of the reasons yams became so important to the diets of enslaved Africans has to do with the fact that they can be prepared in numerous ways. Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed during slavery. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved Africans also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava.  

[plant] 21.237n They are a native of South-America, the West-Indies, and of most parts of Guinea. By Guinea, Grainger refers to a region on the west coast of Africa that bordered the Gulf of Guinea and served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade (Guinea is now the name of a country on the western coast of Africa). There is one South American species of yam named *Dioscorea trifida* that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, but there are no species of yam that originated in the Caribbean islands themselves. More important than *Dioscorea trifida*, however, to the diets of enslaved Africans were the Old World species of yam in West Africa. These species would have included *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa. They also would have included *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century and then brought with slave traders to the Americas.

Grainger may be referring to *Gecarcinus ruricola*, a species of terrestrial crabs widespread throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas. *G. ruricola* is currently the most commonly exploited land crab for human consumption in the Caribbean. Richard Hartnoll, Mark Baine, Yolima Grandas, Jennifer James, and Helen Atkin, "Population Biology of the Black Land Crab, * Gecarcinus ruricola *, in the San Andres Archipelago, Western Caribbean," *Journal of Crustacean Biology* 26.3 (2006): 316-325.

Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.  

27.341n *Lues Venerea*. The term *lues venerea* was applied during the seventeenth century across Europe for all sexually transmitted diseases, often described as a single ailment. Leonardo Botallo of Paris used the term early on in 1563, as did Jean Fernel in 1579, to name syphilis, or the "French pox," and it remained the popular name for syphilis in the eighteenth century. Until the mid-eighteenth century, European medical thought commonly held that the *lues venerea* originated from a single virus. It was not until the nineteenth century that different kinds of sexually transmitted diseases were distinguished with specific names.

27.342n *cholera morbus*. The term *cholera morbus* is used today for the disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was applied to both cholera and cholera-like diseases.

30.407 the shield was forg'd for Peleus' Son. Achilles, the son of Peleus, king of Phthia, and Thetis, a sea goddess. In Homer's *Iliad*, the god Hephaestus (Greek, Hephaistos; Latin, Vulcan) forged an elaborate shield for Achilles after his armor was stripped from Patroclus by Hector. Classical tradition sometimes held that Cyclopes (sing. Cyclops, pl. Cyclopes), a clan of one-eyed giants, were craftsmen who assisted Hephaestus in his forge.

It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

31.425 the arrow's deadening power. Sagittarius, the southern zodiacal constellation depicted as a centaur aiming an arrow, popularly called "the Archer."

By "the arrow's deadening power," Grainger means the November cold.

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*).  

[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. Plantain (family Musaceae), closely related to the banana. Plantains formed an important a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.

[plant] 35.501 oranges. Could be the sour orange (*Citrus aurantium*) or sweet orange (*Citrus sinensis*). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the sour and sweet orange.  

[plant] 35.503 logwood-hedge. Logwood is the commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin.  

35.505 the flux. Flux broadly refers to an abundant flow from an organ or cavity. Diarrhea, for example, is otherwise known as the alvine flux; in the eighteenth century, the gastrointestinal disorder dysentery was often known as the "bloody flux" or "red flux." Risk factors for dysentery include poor sanitation, contaminated water supplies, close living quarters, and malnutrition. Dysentery remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

[plant] 35.508 ricinus. Grainger refers here to the physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 35.508n The plant from which the castor-oil is extracted is also called *Ricinus*. *Ricinus communis*, the castor oil plant.  

[people] 35.508n Ray. John Ray (1627-1705), English naturalist and botanist, author of *Historia plantarum* (*History of Plants*, 1686-1704), a three-volume encyclopedia of plants cataloging 18,600 species.

[plant] 35.508n The species of it which bears red coral-like flowers is named *Bellyach* by the Barbadians. The bellyache bush (*Jatropha gossypiifolia*) is native to the tropical Americas. 

35.508n melancholy. Prior to the eighteenth century, melancholy was understood within the framework of the humoral theory of the body articulated by Aristotle, Galen, and Hippocrates, as a disease caused by an excess of "black bile" and characterized by negative emotions such as fear or sadness without explicit cause. Use of the term had expanded by the time of Grainger's writing to speak more generally of physiological disturbance, listlessness, or dejection.

36.509. cholic. The contracting of hollow organs results in pain called colic.

[plant] 36.510 acassee. Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn.

[plant] 36.520 carnation. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, a shrub that produes showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that the women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved. The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.   

[people] 36.520n Depoinci. General Philippe de Lonvilliers, chevalier de Poincy (1584-1660), governor of the French Antilles from 1647 to 1660.

[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to European naturalists and others concerned with the Americas because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. 

[people] 37.526n. Edwards. <!--who is this?-->

[plant] 38.538 wild liquorice. *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.  

38.543. Vermeil. bright red color.

38.544. Christobelle. <!--not sure who this is-->

[plant] 38.538n Jumbee Beeds. The plant *Abrus precatorius* is a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.

[plant] 38.538n. pigeon-peas. *Cajanus cajan*. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of enslaved Africans because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade. 

38.538n. emetic...pectoral. Emetics produce vomiting. Pectoral drinks aid in digestion.

[plant] 38.538n black ebony. Ebony refers to various Asian and Africa trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.  

[plant] 39.551 myrtle. See note for [internal] Book 1, p. 3. 

[plant] 39.556 citron. *Citrus medica*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the citron. 39.560. Dryad. Wood-nymph.

40.572. yellow death. Most often transmitted by mosquitos, occurs mostly in tropical climates, characterized by jaundice, fever, nausea or vomiting, and aches.

40.580. Montano. Grainger continues the next few pages describing Montano, a fictional planter who he lauds for treating his slaves humanely. It should be noted that this behavior, though presented as virtuous, makes its argument on economic grounds.

[plant] 41.596 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.  

[plant] 41.596 cassada. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava had advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads.  

[plant] 41.597 tanies. Either *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* or *Colocasia esculenta*. The name tanie or tannia technically refers to *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta* were often conflated, however. Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. In addition to being called tanie or tannia, *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* also went by the common name yautia and is native to Central and South America. *Colocasia esculenta*, also known as eddo, dasheen, or taro, is native to Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 C. E. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. 

[plant] 41.596n. a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour.   

[plant] 41.596n. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino. Pineda is Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñá (1607-1680), author of *Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile* (finished 1672).  

[plant] 41.596n. one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*. Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America.  

[plant] 41.597n. three species of tanies, the blue, the scratching, and that which is commonly roasted. There are many different varieties of *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta*. By the scratching kind, Grainger refers to the fact that the leaves of both *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta* contain needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate that irritate the mouth and throat when eaten. 

[plant] 41.597n. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad. Because the leaves caused irritation to those who consumed them and had to be boiled for long periods to reduce the scratching effect, they were mainly consumed by enslaved Africans.  

[people] 42.509. Raleigh. Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618) was an English privateer and courtier who persuaded Elizabeth I to support a colony at Roanoke. He was the the author of *Discoverie of Guiana*.

[plant] 42.601 cotton-shrub. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World.  

[plant] 42.605 cacao-walk. A grove of cacao trees. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[plant] 42.598n custard, star, and sugar-apples. Custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree native to Mexico, Central America, and South America. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (the largest of the Caribbean island groups; includes Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Cayman Islands). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.

43.607. Danae...Theodosia. Danaë is the mother of Perseus and daughter of Acrisius and Eurydice. <!--Theodosia??-->

[plant] 43.605n the addtion of vanellas and other hot ingredients. The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Central America, and other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which are native to the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry to varying degrees. For example, those with choleric (hot and dry) temperaments were supposed to avoid eating any foods also classified as hot or dry. The other humoral temperaments are sanguine (hot and moist), phlegmatic (cold and moist), and melancholic (cold and dry).  

[plant] 43.605n olive. The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years. It is a symbol of the Mediterranean, as well as a symbol of wealth, abundance, power, and peace.   

[plant] 43.605n *Madre de Cacao*. *Gliricidia sepium*. Native to Central and South America, used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[plant] 43.605n cassada, or bananas. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava had advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Bananas belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related to plantains. They formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of banana and plantain originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The banana and plantain probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 43.605n good pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[plant] 43.605n cucumber. The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) is native to South Asia, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the early eighteenth century. 

[plant] 43.605n There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the clour and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown today in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

[plant] 43.605n This word is Indian. "Cacao" derives from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."

43.606n. Persian. Now Iran, the Persian empire which, at its height, spanned from Egypt through southwestern Asia to India.

43.606n. Arabia Felix. The name Ptolemy gave to the south and southwest of Arabia because of its fertile landscape.

[plant] 44.625 tamarind-vista. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*) produces a fruit with a sticky, acidic pulp that has been used as a food ingredient for thousands of years. It is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 44.606n tea. *Camellia sinensis* is the species from which commercially produced tea is derived. It is native to Southeast Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

[plant] 44.625n senna. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.

Aethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference and African inferiority based on skin color.  

93.108 Phosphor. The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.

Enslaved Africans who were assigned to the task of milling sugar-cane worked under extremely difficult and fatiguing conditions. Workers had to feed cut sugar-cane stalks through the mill, which contained wooden or metal rollers that crushed the cane and extracted its juice for further processing. Because plantation owners and managers demanded near constant work during the season of sugar-cane harvesting, accidents like the one described by Grainger were common. By "put out of the wind," Grainger refers to the fact that the mill was powered by an attached windmill, which drove the rollers.

105.334 dropsy. Edema, an excessive accumulation of fluid in bodily tissues.  

105.335 boilers, (prime of slaves,). Working conditions in the boiling house were extremely difficult, and only the strongest slaves were assigned there. Tasks included stoking the fires to boil the sugarcane juice and skimming or removing the impurities that rose to the top of the boiling cane juice. Being a boiler was more than merely physical work, however: it also required considerable technical and practical knowledge about the process of sugar production and refinement, and masters depended heavily on their head refiners or boilers for good yields of sugar from their crops.  

105.340 perflation. Ventilation provided by air blowing through a space.  

105.347 essential salts. Eighteenth-century scientists studying the composition of plants posited that they contained essential salts or acids and minerals obtained by the crystallization of plant juices.  

106.352 acor. Acidic or sour substance.  

106.350n arrack. An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).

106.350n it forthwith bursts it. The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.  

[people] 106.350n Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).    

[plant] 106.357n *Dumb Cane*. *Dieffenbachia seguine*. Native to tropical America, the dumb cane looks very similar to sugarcane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugarcane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours.  

[people] 106.357n A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time. Thomas Trapham, author of *A Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica* (1679).

107.361 cades. Casks or barrels.  

107.363 lime-stone thoroughly calcin’d. Limestone is a rock that yields lime when calcined or burnt. Lime was used in Grainger's time to refine sugar: when boiled with sugar, lime precipitates impurities.  

[place] 107.364. Bristol, Britannia's second mart and eye!. City located in the southwest of England, one of England's most important sugar-refining cities in the eighteenth century. Although the initial steps of sugar production happened in the Caribbean, sugar was further refined in Britain before being sold to consumers there. Bristol became a center for sugar refining in part because it had ample supplies of limestone.  

107.366 "to thy waters only trust for fame." A line from William Whitehead's poem, "An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol Spring" (1751).  

[place] 107.371 Avon's. Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from the Warwickshire Avon or Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process.  

[place] 108.380 Sabrina. A poetic name for the River Severn, which is Britain's longest river and empties into the Bristol Channel.  

108.381 marble. A metamorphic rock formed by applying great heat and pressure to limestone.

109.412 make labour light. While Grainger recommends letting enslaved Africans drink the sugarcane juice, planters sometimes inflicted severe punishments for eating or consuming sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thsitlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth. Douglas Hall, *In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86* (London: Macmillan, 1989).   

109.413 coppers. Kettles for boiling the juice pressed out of the sugarcanes.

114.504 Pomona. Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit.  

114.507 ebriety. State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.  

[place] 114.508 Albion. Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

[people] 114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade (for Johnson's exact comment, see the note for [internal] Book IV, lines 74-77). Privately, Johnson and other members of his literary circle also may have found Grainger's attempts to aestheticize subjects related to sugar cultivation ludicrous. For instance, at a reading of *The Sugar-Cane* manuscript that took place at the home of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a well-known painter and close friend of Johnson's, the line, "Now Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. The line does not appear in the published version of the poem.  

[people] 114.509 Percy. See note for [internal] Book II, line 452.  

[people] 114.509 White. The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated May 9, 1801, written to Thomas Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes's *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811. *The Percy Letters: The Correspondence of Thomas Percy and Robert Anderson*, vol. 9, edited by W. E. K. Anderson, Yale University Press, 1944, at pp. 59, 67-68, 269.  

114.510 Calpe. Calpe refers to one of the Pillars of Hercules in Greek mythology, now known as the Rock of Gibraltar.

[plant] 115.522 sand-box shade. The sand-box (*Hura crepitans*), a tree native to tropical America.  

115.531 reed-built huts. Dwellings of enslaved Africans.  

[plant] 115.533 With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep. Plantains and bananas both belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that enslaved Africans often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Plantains and bananas were widely consumed by free inhabitants of the Caribbean as well. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

115.522n emetic. A medicine that excites vomiting.  

[plant] 116.549 tamarinds. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*), native to tropical Africa and western Asia but naturalized to and cultivated in the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.

116.549n intenerate. To make tender, soften.  

116.549n ringworms. Ringworm, or tinea, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.  

117.550 Iris. Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods.  

117.555 Hesperian throats. "Hesperian throats" refers to the Hesperides, the daughters of Night and Erebus who guarded the tree of golden apples given by Hera to earth, also renowned for their singing. Because the tree was popularly located beyond the Atlas mountains at the western border of the Ocean, Hesperian also means western.  

117.558 herald-lark. Larks may name any of several small birds of the family Alaudidae. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World, larks are also conventionally associated with the dawn.  

117.652 Phoebus. Phoebus, an alternate name for the Greek god Apollo and used in contexts where Apollo is identified with the sun.  

117.549n anthelmintic. Anthelmintic (also anthelminthic, antihelminthic) drugs are used to expel or kill parasitic worms, especially intestinal ones.  

118.570 Deep, moral truths convey. By the time Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane*, there was a long-standing tradition in European literature of using insects to represent moral, religious, and philosophical ideas. Most notably, Virgil's *Georgics* inspired Grainger and other neo-georgic writers to use bees as symbols of orderly plurality.  

118.578 Why will their sons, ungrateful, roam abroad? Grainger refers here either to the common practice of absentee plantership, in which plantation owners lived in Britain and managed their plantations from afar, or to the equally common practice of sending children of planters to Britain for education.  

118.587 Bellona. Bellona, the Roman goddess of war.  

[people] 119.592 heaven-favoured bard. Grainger's "heaven-favoured bard" alludes to Tyrtaeus. See note for [internal] Book III, line 600.

Its range includes the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Now a critically endangered species. William Dampier first named it in print in his 1697 *Voyages and Descriptions: A Voyage to New Holland*, remarking, "The Jew-Fish is a very good Fish, and I judge so called by the English, because it hath Scales and Fins, therefore a clean Fish, according to Levitical Law." <!--Mention the renaming controversy?->   

[people] 119.596n General George Townshend. George Townshend, first Marquess Townshend (1724-1807), an English politician and caricaturist who also had a distinguished military career, serving as second in command to Major-General James Wolfe in Canada during the Seven Years' War and then as overall commander after Wolfe's death during the campaign to take French-held Quebec, which surrendered to British forces in 1759.

[people] 120.613n Colonel Christopher Codrington, for building a college in Barbadoes, and converting Negroes to the Christian religion. Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born in Barbados and belonged to the wealthy Codrington family, which owned sugar plantations in Antigua and Barbados and leased land in Barbuda. Codrington served as deputy-governor of Barbados and governor-general of the Leeward Islands. At his death in 1710, he bequeathed his Barbados plantations and a share of the island of Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), an Anglican missionary organization that aimed to convert colonial inhabitants, including enslaved and free Africans, to Christianity. In 1745, the SPG opened Codrington College, which initially served only white colonists.

127.51 mechanic art. Here Grainger recommends that enslaved persons from the Congo be assigned specific trades rather than be forced to work as field laborers.  
127.52 ductile. Malleable; flexible.

128.62 Golden Coast. One of the four major trading region defined by European nations on the coast of West Africa.  These included the Grain Coast (modern day Sierra Leone and Liberia), the Ivory Coast (modern Cote d'Ivoire), the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and the Slave Coast (modern Togo, Benin, and Nigeria). These modern designations are approximations of eighteenth-century geographical regions. Certainly, people were enslaved from a much of the West African coast ranging at least from Senegal to Angola. <!-- Although I wrote it, this note makes me uncomfortable for all kinds of reasons CS -->  
128.63 Papaws. Also Popo. West African in the region between Accra in modern day Ghana and Ouidah in Benin. <!--see Gilmore too-->
128.65 Volta. Volta river in Ghana, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Accra (in modern Ghana).  
128.65 Rey. Likely the Rey (or Rio del Rey) estuary in modern day Cameroon. It is not clear whether Grainger means a specific river within this system.  
128.71 oft by suicide.

130.106 learned leach. Physician.  
130.108 Phoebus. The sun.  
130.110 Elysium. Part of the Greek underworld reserved for heroes.  
130.113 Quanza. Cuanzo river in modern Angola. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean south of Luanda (known in the eighteenth century as Loango or Loando). This line therefore refers to enslaved people from Angola, who were primarily victims of the Portuguese trade.  
130.114 prone to bloat <!--not sure about this one-->  
130.119 Ethiop. Generic term for African, rather a person from Ethiopia.  
130.121 Machaon. Greek physician and son of Asclepius (son of Apollo and god of medicine).  
130.123 vervain. Plant from the *Verbena* family, widely used in medicine from at least the time of the ancient Egyptians.

130.133 The novel gang. Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.  Here Grainger is describing a practice known as "seasoning".
130.136 acajou. Cashew tree (*Anacardium occidentale*) native to Brazil. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic and is said to have been used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles. See for example Maria Riddell, *Voyages to the Madeira, and Leeward Isles* (Edinburgh, 1792), 82-83.  

132.141 rheums. Mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold, but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illness.  
132.141 dysenteric. Having to do with dysentery, or diarrhea.  
132.142 hydrops. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema). <!--Gilmore has diabetes, which might make more sense in context-->  
132.144 Lybians. Here used as a generic term for Africans.  
132n Gum-Arabic. Edible sap from the Acacia tree used as a glue/binder in foods and medicines.  
132.150 swallow dirt. Physicians and enslavers were fascinated with geophagy, or dirt eating among enslaved Africans (also called pica). They variously thought it was the symptom of a physical or psychological ailment that would invariably lead to death.  
132.150 Chlorotic fair. Chlorosis (also called green sickness) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

133.151 poignant cates. Food. Here Grainger uses it in the sense of "delicacies".  
133.152 dropsy. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body.  The modern term is Edema (or oedema).  
133.156 Paean. Apollo.  
133.160 provender. Food for cattle.  Especially hay and dried grains.

133.163 conch. Family of marine molluscs best know for their large shells, which can be used as musical horns when properly blown.  
133.165 Nor, Negroe. This and the following 40 lines are the only in the poem where the narrator addresses the enslaved directly.  
133.169 dark tartarean caves. Having to do with Tartarus, the part of the Greek underworld reserved for the wicked. Here Grainger refers to the work of miners.  

134.173 And in dread ruin all its inmates whelm?. Improved technology in the seventeenth century facilitated the construction of deeper coal mines in Scotland, where coal was a major domestic export in the eighteenth century. The rising demand for coal quickly exhausted accessible deposits, necessitating deeper mines that extended hundreds of feet into the earth. Unsupported rocks and flooding during heavy rains led to fatal collapses within the underground shafts and tunnels, and poor ventilation meant that flammable gases such as carbon monoxide and methane could ignite the combustible coal dust in the air, causing devastating dust explosions.  

134.175 exhalations of the deep-dug mine. When steam-driven pumps and winders became available in the mining industry, lead was mined in long seams in the fashion of trenches; during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the steam engine's ability to pump water through underground channels to wind the ore to the surface allowed for mines to be dug deeper. See also note for [internal] Book IV, line 173.  

134.178 Scotia. Scotia, a name for Scotland. Southwestern Scotland had produced lead since the Roman period. The Scottish Habeas Corpus Act of 1701 did not apply to those in servitude in the coal and lead mines of Scotland, who could be bound in serf-like bondage to employers by ancient custom. Such workers could be sold or leased with the undertaking of mining work and were accounted as a part of the inventory. Vagabonds and their families could be seized and returned to work. It was not until 1774 that an Emancipation Act forbade mine owners from accepting new servitudes and provided for the emancipation of existing workers who had served for a certain number of years. Only in 1799 were all miners legally freed.  

134.180 palsies. Palsy, paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

134.181 Who, on the margin of the the rocky Drave. As Grainger's footnote to this line explains, the Drave, or Drava, is a river in central Europe. It forms the boundary between Croatia and Hungary. Silver was a major mineral output for central European regions in Germany, Hungary, and Tyrol, particularly in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, until the discovery of gold and silver mines in South America shifted western European attentions further abroad.  

134.187 See them dragg'd in chains. With the chained people, Grainger adverts to Spanish colonial oppression and exploitation of native populations in South America. The Incan empire, alluded to in line 185, extended from modern Ecuador to Chile in the early sixteenth century when Spanish conquistadors arrived and imposed colonial rule. In particular, the silver mines at Potosí in Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) drove Spanish settlement, and native populations were subjected to the *encomienda* system, in which an *encomendero* accepted tribute and obligatory labor from natives in return for protection. In the early seventeenth century this gave way to a *corregimiento* system that established networks of provincial governors who managed the labor distribution and tributary arrangements. African slaves were also imported and put to work in mines when labor ran short, gradually surpassing the natives in population size. Besides silver, gold deposits were found throughout the Andes, from Venezuela to Chile, and European settlers expanded the extant mining work of the native Americans in both scale and productivity.  

135.207 humours. In classical and medieval medicine, humours denoted four bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, choler, melancholy or black bile) that were believed to determine an individual's state of health and temperament according to their proportions in the body. The term also came to be used more generally to refer to various other bodily fluids and the balance thereof, whether normal or abnormal.  

136.215 Indus. Indus, a river in southern Asia, rising in the Kailas mountain range in Tibet and flowing through India and Pakistan.  

136.229 these uninstructed swains. See note for [internal] Book I, line 9.  

137.246 worm. Guinea worm, or the dragon worm (*Dracunculus medinensis*), is a parasitic nematode acquired by drinking water contaminated by the water flea *Cyclops*, which carries the worm's larvae. The larvae break through the stomach lining and enter the bloodstream, growing to full size within a year. A pregnant female worm lives in connective tissues beneath the skin and eventually will release its larvae into a large blister, usually on the legs or arms. The worm's migration produces symptoms such as itching, giddiness, breathing difficulties, vomiting, and diarrhea. The worm may come out spontaneously with the released larvae, but typically treatment involved attaching the worm to the end of a stick and winding it slowly out of the opening in the skin over the course of several days—this is the "leaden cylinder" that Grainger mentions in line 252. A broken worm causes an extreme allergic reaction that can be fatal, and blisters on the skin may ulcerate and become infected, resulting in an abscess and the "annual lameness" of which Grainger warns in line 255. Today the worm may also be treated through anthelmintics.  

137.255 Moor. Moor, a name for a native or inhabitant of Mauretania in North Africa, which corresponds to present-day Morocco and Algeria. The name also came to be applied to Muslim people of mixed Berber and Arab descent in North Africa.  

138.256 dragon worm. Also known as the guinea worm or the medina worm (*Dracunculus medinensis*), it is a parasitic worm of the phylum Nematoda that lives in tropical regions of Asia, Africa, South America, and the West Indies and causes the disease known as guinea worm disease.

[place] 143.363. Lusitania's. A Roman province named for its inhabitants, the Lusitani. Modern-day Portugal.

143.369. bewitch'd. A reference to obeah, a set of Afro-Caribbean medicinal and religious practices. Colonial descriptions of obeah vary from magic to superstition to folk medicine. (general outline drawn from *Atlantic Studies* vol. 12 no. 2 "Obeah: knowledge, power, and writing in the early Atlantic World"). Colonial writers describe enslaved persons using plants or herbs to heal sickness or bring the dead back to life as well as deploying charms to defend against bullets or death, among other uses. Most accounts register the rebellious nature of these practices, and Grainger's poem was published in the aftermath of a large, coordinated 1760 rebellion in Jamaica that involved approximately 1,500 enslaved persons in which obeah played a particularly important role. (see Vincent Brown's http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html) <!--how much would we like to include in a footnote if we are also writing an essay about obeah? Can definitely cite specific examples (Long, Sloane, Singleton, Moseley, etc.)-->

[people] 147.424 Ethiop. Ethiop and Ethiopia (also Aethiop and Aethiopia) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Ethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Ethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Ethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference and African inferiority based on skin color.  

147.430 Deny subsistence to their labouring slaves. Grainger addresses the fact that planters regularly provided plantation laborers with insufficient provisions to economize on costs. At the same time, planters did not engage in the large-scale cultivation of provision crops on Caribbean lands because they wanted to dedicate all fertile land to sugar. As a result, although they were required to work full-time producing sugar and other commodity crops, enslaved laborers frequently were required to tend provision gardens or plots of land upon which they cultivated food crops to supplement the provisions provided by planters. The lands allotted for provision grounds were generally rocky, mountainous plots with poor soil. 

[plant] 147.434 English beans, or Carolinian rice. Beans or peas, as they were often called in the Caribbean, were a major source of nutrition for the enslaved. English beans are also known as fava, broad, or horse beans (*Vicia faba*), which originated in Western Asia thousands of years ago and spread from there to Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. They were sometimes sent from England to the Caribbean to serve as provisions. They also formed part of the provisions of slave ships. The horse bean was not as central to the diets of the enslaved as other bean species, however, many of which were cultivated by the enslaved themselves. Rice also did not make up a major part of the diets of the enslaved, but South Carolina was the major Atlantic exporter of the rice species known as *Oryza sativa*, which originated in Asia. There is also a species of rice indigenous to Africa known as *Oryza glaberrima*. Enslaved Africans occasionally may have grown both *Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima* in their provision grounds and gardens, but it never was a major source of subsistence.  

147.435 Iërne's beef, or Pensilvanian flour;. Iërne is a term for Ireland, which supplied Caribbean plantations with salted beef and other provisions. Beef also came from the North American colonies, as did flour. 

147.436 Newfoundland cod, or herrings from the main. The waters off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic constituted one of the major fisheries of the world for the Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) in the eighteenth century. Planters imported cod for enslaved laborers, who needed protein to function, but they imported what came to be known as "West India cod," which was salted cod of the poorest quality.  

148.448 This let them cultivate, one day, each week. Enslaved laborers generally were required to go to their provision grounds one day per week to tend them. In certain colonies, however, an internal marketing system gradually emerged that may have encouraged some to spend extra time cultivating their provision grounds. For instance, in Jamaica, those who participated in the system were able to sell or trade their provisions for other goods and currency. They were also able to supplement the inadequate diet provided to them by planters, although those individuals who cultivated provision grounds did not enjoy, on average, better health or longer lifespans than those dependent primarily on imported rations. Still, the provision grounds did offer their cultivators some control over what they ate, as they were responsible for choosing what plants to cultivate, and, in limited cases, they also offered some degree of economic autonomy. They also laid the foundation for the peasant economies that emerged in the British Caribbean in the post-emancipation era.  

[plant] 148.449 And there raise yams, and there cassada's root. Yams, one of many species of tuber within the *Dioscorea* genus, were widely cultivated in provision grounds, in part because they did not require regular care to thrive. There are several other reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era and subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well, although it was not as important a food source as the yam. Nevertheless, it still appeared in provision grounds because it is an easy crop to cultivate: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. These advantages offset cassava's toxic nature: its roots, which are the parts of the plant prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw roots are poisonous to human beings. The poison can be neutralized by proper processing, however: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads.  

[plant] 148.454-455 There let angola's bloomy bush supply, For many a year, with wholesome pulse their board. Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of enslaved Africans because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

[plant] 148.456 bonavist. A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) native to Cape Verde, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.  

[people] 148.449n Ogilvy's America. John Ogilby's *America: Being an accurate description of the New World* (1670).  

[plant] 149.457-458 ochra...slimy pulp...help disdains. Okra (*Abelmoschus esculentus*) is native to tropical Africa and was one of the most commonly cultivated plants in the provision grounds and gardens of the enslaved. It possesses a glutinous or slimy pulp that was used as a thickener in stews called pepper pots, one of the most popular dishes in the colonial Caribbean.  

[plant] 149.459-460 potatos...Sweet as the cane-juice is the root they bear. Grainger refers to sweet potatoes (*Ipomoea batatas*), not to be confused with potatoes (*Solanum tuberosum*) or yams (genus *Dioscorea*). The sweet potato is native to Central America or northwestern South America but had spread to the Caribbean islands by the time of Columbus' first voyage. It was an important food crop for Amerindians.  

[plant] 149.461 eddas. *Colocasia esculenta* or *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. The name edda or eddo commonly refers to *Colocasia esculenta*. *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* were often conflated, however. Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. In addition to being called edda or eddo, *Colocasia esculenta* also went by the common names dasheen or taro. It is native to Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 C. E. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* also went by the common name yautia and is native to Central and South America.  

[plant] 149.462 Indian cale, and foodful calaloo. The term "Indian cale" also can refer to the species *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. Since the seventeenth century, "callaloo" has been used to refer to several different plants. Today, callaloo usually refers to *Amaranthus viridis*, a plant native to the tropical Americas. What the various plants labeled callaloo had in common was the ability of their leaves to serve as edible greens. They are also weedy plants that can survive in a wide range of environments, including wastelands. They formed an important part of the diets of enslaved Africans, probably because they are a hardy and reliable source of food.  

[plant] 149.463 mint. Plants of the genus *Mentha*, distributed around the world.  

[plant] 149.463 thyme. Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeast tropical Africa.

[plant] 150.471 coffee. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[plant] 150.474 cocô. Another term for cacao. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

150.474 thy rich pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

150.475 Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require. Cacao trees take several years to produce pods that can be harvested.  

150.476 Ere the stone grind them to the food of health. The cacao seeds, also known as the beans or nuts, inside cacao pods are ground up to produce chocolate, which was branded as early as the seventeenth century as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is also possible that maroons or escaped slaves living in autonomous communities in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food. See William Hughes, *The American Physitian; Or, A Treatise of the Roots, Plants, Tress, Shrubs, Fruit, Herbs, &c. Growing in the English Plantations in America* 131.  

[plant] 150.478-479 And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd, With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;. Madre de Cacao (*Gliricidia sepium*). Native to Central and South America, used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[plant] 150.466n The orange tree. Could be the sour orange (*Citrus aurantium*) or sweet orange (*Citrus sinensis*). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the sour and sweet orange.  

[people] 150.485-486 negro-fugitives...in bands will soon destroy Thy labourer's honest wealth; their loss and yours. Grainger could be referring to runaway slaves or, because of the mention of bands, maroons, runaways who formed autonomous communities and lived outside the plantation.   

[place] 151.488 Indian gardens. Early colonial reports from the Caribbean describe flourishing Amerindian gardens. Amerindians generally practiced conuco or mound cultivation, in which various crops were intercropped or cultivated together in ecologically sustainable fashion.

The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*) was native to tropical Africa and western Asia but naturalized to and cultivated in the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

[plant] 152.513 cassia. Most likely *Cassia fistula*, a tree native to India, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia that was being cultivated in the Caribbean by the early sixteenth century. Used as a purgative.

It is a sweet fruit native to Mexico and Central America. Another fruit commonly confused with the mammee apple and mammee sapota is the nasebery (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the sapodilla or the nispero. It is a sour or tart fruit native to Mexico, Central America, and Colombia.
