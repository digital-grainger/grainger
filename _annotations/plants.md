[plant] 3.1 Cane. *Saccharum officinarum*. A large tufted perennial grass probably native to Southeast Asia and first carried to the Americas by Columbus. By the eighteenth century, widely cultivated on Caribbean plantations by enslaved African laborers so that European and North American consumers could enjoy sugar. 

[plant] 6.34 wild red cedar. Most likely *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. Now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

[plant] 6.34 locust. The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey but now spread widely over the world. It is the source of carob, which is used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.  

[plant] 6.34n white and red [cedar]. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

[plant] 6.34n cedars cultivated in the Bermudas. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

[plant] 7.36 cassia. Most likely *Cassia fistula*, a tree native to India, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia that was being cultivated in the Caribbean by the early sixteenth century. Used as a purgative.  

[plant] 7.36 ceiba. *Ceiba pentandra*, also known as the kapok or silk-cotton tree. Native to Central and South America, the ceiba can achieve a height of 50 meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds.  

[plant] 7.37 guava. Fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, probably native to Central and South America but naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.   

[plant] 7.37 guaiac. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae (Latin for 'wood of life') becuase it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.   

[plant] 8.44 shaddoc. A citrus fruit *Citrus maxima* also known as the pomelo or pummelo. Native to Southeast Asia and known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by a Captain Shaddock.  

[plant] 8.44 forbidden fruit. Refers to species of *Citrus* (family Rutaceae) that are now virtually extinct but perhaps still exist in some parts of the Caribbean. Similar in taste to oranges and shaddocks, closely related to the grapefruit.  

[plant] 8.45 acajou. The cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*), native to Central and South America. While the nut is important to commerce today, the "cashew apple" or receptacle for the nut also was consumed during the eighteenth century. 

[plant] 8.45 sabbaca. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 8.45n two species; the one bearing a green fruit...and the other a red...and grows chiefly in Mexico. There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.  

[plant] 8.45n the pear named Lady's-thighs. Also known as the Cuisse madame or jargonelle pear (*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'). One of the oldest pears in cultivation.  

[plant] 8.45n *Bois d'anise*. French: anise wood. The leaves of some varieties of avocado give off a scent of anise when crushed.    

[plant] 10.45n tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton-plantations. In addition to sugar, tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton were major Caribbean agricultural commodities. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*) is native to the Americas. Indigo (genus *Indigofera*) is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.  

[plant] 14.126 guaiac. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae (Latin for 'wood of life') becuase it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.   

[plant] 14.132 bearded fig. *Ficus citrifolia*, also known as the wild banyan tree, is native to the tropical Americas. It is the national tree of Barbados.  

[plant] 19.213 lily. Fleur-de-lis, a lily-shaped ornament that symbolizes France.

[plant] 20.234 provender. Generic term for dried cattle feed (e.g., hay).

[plant] 20.237 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.   

[plant] 21.237n boiled or roasted. One of the reasons yams became so important to the diets of enslaved Africans has to do with the fact that they can be prepared in numerous ways. Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed during slavery. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved Africans also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava.  

[plant] 21.237n They are a native of South-America, the West-Indies, and of most parts of Guinea. By Guinea, Grainger refers to a region on the west coast of Africa that bordered the Gulf of Guinea and served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade (Guinea is now the name of a country on the western coast of Africa). There is one South American species of yam named *Dioscorea trifida* that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, but there are no species of yam that originated in the Caribbean islands themselves. More important than *Dioscorea trifida*, however, to the diets of enslaved Africans were the Old World species of yam in West Africa. These species would have included *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa. They also would have included *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century and then brought with slave traders to the Americas.  

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*) is native to tropical Africa. Although eaten in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, some believed that its taste was too watery and that it could cause stomach problems and even worms.  

[plant] 26.337n cedar. Red cedar (*Cedrela odorata*) has a strong odor.  

[plant] 27.342n mahoe-berry. Perhaps the berries from the blue mahoe (*Hibiscus elatus*), a tree native to Cuba and Jamaica and naturalized to other parts of the Caribbean. Now the national tree of Jamaica.  

[plant] 29.378 wild fig. Also known as bearded fig or the wild banyan tree (*Ficus citrifolia*).  

[plant] 29.393 fern-tree shades. Tree ferns are primitive plants that belong to the order Cyatheales. Grainger may have been referencing *Cyathea arborea*, sometimes known as the West Indian treefern, which can grow up to 9 meters tall.  

[plant] 31.418 anana. The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*), which is native to eastern South America and brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean.  

[plant] 31.420 avocato. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*).  

[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. Plantain (family Musaceae), closely related to the banana. Plantains formed an important a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 31.418n cherimoya. *Annona cherimola*, a fruit originally from the South American highlands.  

[plant] 31.418n wild pine-apple, or ananas bravo. *Bromelia pinguin*. Found throughout Central America and the Caribbean. 

[plant] 35.499 limes, with lemons. Columbus brought limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*) to the Caribbean, and he probably also brought lemons (*Citrus limon*). 

[plant] 35.501 oranges. Could be the sour orange (*Citrus aurantium*) or sweet orange (*Citrus sinensis*). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the sour and sweet orange.  

[plant] 35.503 logwood-hedge. Logwood is the commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin.  

[plant] 35.508 ricinus. Grainger refers here to the physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 35.508n The plant from which the castor-oil is extracted is also called *Ricinus*. *Ricinus communis*, the castor oil plant.  

[plant] 35.508n The species of it which bears red coral-like flowers is named *Bellyach* by the Barbadians...melancholy. The bellyache bush (*Jatropha gossypiifolia*) is native to the tropical Americas.  

[plant] 36.510 acassee. Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn.  

[plant] 36.515 privet. Refers to any of a number of shrubs belonging to the genus *Ligustrum*. Native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia, commonly used for hedging. Some species are invasive.  

[plant] 36.520 carnation. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, a shrub that produes showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that the women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved. The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.    

[people] 36.520n Depoinci. General Philippe de Lonvilliers, chevalier de Poincy (1584-1660), governor of the French Antilles from 1647 to 1660.  

[plant] 36.520n senna kind. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.  

36.520n stomachic. Good for the stomach.  

36.520n carminative. Having the quality of expelling flatulence.  

36.520n emmenagogue. Having the power to induce menstrual flow.  

36.520n *Cauda pavonis*. Latin: peacock's tail.  

36.520n *Flower Fence*. Another common name for *Caesalpinia pulcherrima* because it was frequently used as a flowering barrier fence.  

36.520n Guinea. A region on the west coast of Africa that bordered the Gulf of Guinea and served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade.  Guinea is now the name of a country on the western coast of Africa.  

[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to European naturalists and others concerned with the Americas because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. 

[plant] 38.538 wild liquorice. *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry and good-luck charms, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.  

38.536n The former is sometimes eaten, but the other seldom. The fruits and pads of *Opuntia* cacti have constituted an important food source for human beings and animals.  

38.536n fucus. A paint or cosmetic for beautifying the skin, a wash or coloring for the face.  

38.536n It grows naturally in some parts of Spain. *Opuntia ficus-indica* was introduced to Spain by Christopher Columbus upon his return from his first voyage.  

[plant] 38.536n guava jellies. Refers to a jelly made from guava, a fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, probably native to Central and South America but naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.

38.536n scandent. Climbing, ascending.  

[plant] 38.538n Jumbee Beeds. The plant *Abrus precatorius* is a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry and good-luck charms, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.

[plant] 38.538n. pigeon-peas. *Cajanus cajan*. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of enslaved Africans because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

38.538n emetic. Have the power to induce vomiting.  

[plant] 38.538n black ebony. Ebony refers to various Asian and Africa trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.  

[plant] 39.551 myrtle. See note for [internal] Book 1, p. 3. 

[plant] 39.556 citron. *Citrus medica*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the citron.    

[plant] 41.596 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.  

[plant] 41.596 cassada. 

[plant] 41.597 tanies. 

[plant] 41.596n. a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. 

[plant] 41.596n. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. 

[plant] 41.596n. one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*.

[plant] 41.597n. three species of tanies, the blue, the scratching, and that which is commonly roasted. 

[plant] 41.597n. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad. 

[plant] 42.598 soursop. The soursop (*Annona muricata*) is the fruit of a tree native Mexico, Central America, and South America. 

[plant] 42.599 ginger. Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) is probably native to India and was brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 42.599 Ralegh's pungent plant. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*).  

[plant] 42.601 cotton-shrub. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World.  

[plant] 42.605 cacao-walk. 

[plant] 42.598n custard, star, and sugar-apples. Custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree native to Mexico, Central America, and South America. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (the largest of the Caribbean island groups; includes Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Cayman Islands). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.  

[plant] 42.598n guava. Fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, probably native to Central and South America but naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.   

[plant] 43.606 coffee. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.  

[plant] 43.605n chocolate. 

[plant] 43.605n the addtion of vanellas and other hot ingredients. The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Central America, and other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which are native to the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry to varying degrees. For example, those with choleric (hot and dry) temperaments were supposed to avoid eating any foods also classified as hot or dry. The other humoral temperaments are sanguine (hot and moist), phlegmatic (cold and moist), and melancholic (cold and dry).  

[plant] 43.605n olive. The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years. It is a symbol of the Mediterranean, as well as a symbol of wealth, abundance, power, and peace.   

*[plant] 43.605n cassada, or bananas. Cassava is *Manihot esculenta*. Bananas belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related to plantains. They formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of banana and plantain originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The banana and plantain probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 43.605n cucumber. The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) is native to South Asia, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the early eighteenth century. 

[plant] 43.605n There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the clour and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. 

[plant] 44.625 tamarind-vista. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*) produces a fruit with a sticky, acidic pulp that has been used as a food ingredient for thousands of years. It is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 44.606n tea. *Camellia sinensis* is the species from which commercially produced tea is derived. It is native to Southeast Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

[plant] 44.625n senna. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.
