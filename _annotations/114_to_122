114.502 Ceres. Italo-Roman goddess of growth.  

114.503 Vigornian. Latin name for Worcester, England.

114.504 Pomona. Roman goddess of fruit.  

114.507 ebriety. State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.  

114.508 Albion. Britain or England. The term is of ancient Celtic origin, but it may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to England's white cliffs of Dover.  

114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals as well, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade (for Johnson's exact comment, see the note for [internal] Book IV, lines 74-77). There are also rumors that Johnson and other members of his literary circle privately found Grainger's attempts to aestheticize subjects related to sugar cultivation ludicrous. For instance, at a reading of *The Sugar-Cane* manuscript that took place at the home of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a well-known painter and close friend of Johnson's, the line, "Now Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. The line does not appear in the published version of the poem. Shaun Irlam, "'Wish You Were Here': Exporting England in James Grainger's 'The Sugar-Cane,'" *ELH* 68.2 (2001): 377-396.

115.531 reed-built huts. Dwellings of enslaved Africans.

115.533 With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep. Plantains and bananas both belong to the family *Musaceae* and are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around the "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that enslaved Africans often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Plantains and bananas were widely consumed by free inhabitants of the Caribbean as well. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in Southeast Asia thousands of years ago, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were also introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands from the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century. B. W. Higman, *Jamaican Food: History, Biology, Culture* (Kingston, Jamaica: U of the West Indies P, 2008), 133-139.

118.578 Why will their sons, ungrateful, roam abroad? Grainger refers here either to the common practice of absentee plantership, in which plantation owners lived in Britain and managed their plantations from afar, or to the equally common practice engaged by planters of sending their children born in the Caribbean to Britain for education.

At his death in 1710, he bequeathed his Barbados plantations and a share of the island of Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), an Anglican missionary organization that aimed to convert colonial inhabitants, including enslaved and free Africans, to Christianity. In 1745, the SPG opened Codrington College, which initially served only white colonists.
