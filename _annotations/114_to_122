114.502 Ceres. Italo-Roman goddess of growth.  

114.503 Vigornian. Latin name for Worcester, England.

114.504 Pomona. Roman goddess of fruit.  

114.507 ebriety. State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.  

114.508 Albion. Britain or England. The term is of ancient Celtic origin, but it may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to England's white cliffs of Dover.  

114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Most famous for his *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals as well, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Moreover, Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade (for Johnson's exact comment, see the note to Book IV, lines 74-77). There are also rumors that Johnson and other members of his literary circle privately found Grainger's attempts to aestheticize subjects related to sugar cultivation ludicrous. For instance, at a reading of *The Sugar-Cane* manuscript that took place at the home of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a well-known painter and friend of Johnson's, Grainger's line, "Now Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter.
