Advertisement. William Shenstone. William Shenstone (1714-1763), English poet and famed practitioner of landscape gardening, which he practiced on his estate, The Leasowes. <!--confirm page number for Advertisement -->  

53.6 no circling mules press dulcet streams. Animals like mules, horses, and cattle were often used to power sugar mills.  

53.7 coppers. Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.  

53.9 Vulcan's aid. Roman god of fire. Here, Grainger refers to the use of fire in the process of distilling spirits from fermented molasses.

54.15 The Boreal morn. The aurora borealis or northern lights.

55.35 monkey-nation. Monkeys are not indigenous to St. Kitts, but the vervet or African green monkey (*Cercopithecus aethiops*) had been introduced by the seventeenth or even sixteenth century. Vervets most likely arrived in the Caribbean via slave ships from Africa. They quickly came to be considered pests because they established themselves in large numbers on the island and traveled around it in troops, raiding colonists' crops. Today, the St. Kitts vervet population exceeds the human one, and vervets are still known for destroying farmers' crops (and stealing tourists' cocktails). Controversially, many of the vervets are now killed or trapped to serve in medical experiments. 

55.38 gambols. Leaps or capers, as made in dancing or playing.  

55.44 Indian crops. Sugar.  

55.46 droles. Also droll, a buffoon or jester. 

55.46 Liamuiga. St. Kitts. 

55.46n Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

56.55 Gallic hosts. Hostile French forces. Here, Grainger makes an analogy between the vervet monkeys and the French during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), the first truly global war that resulted in the establishment of Britain as the preeminent maritime and colonial power.    

56.59 Albion's martial sons. Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (albus) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

56.62 whisker'd vermine-race. Refers eiher to the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) or the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), two Old World species of rats that arrived in the Caribbean with colonization and are now considered invasive species. This line of the poem also relates to one of the most famous and perhaps apocryphal stories about the reception and publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. At a reading of a manuscript draft of the poem that took place at the home of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a well-known painter, the line, "Now Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. In response, Grainger supposedly deleted the word "rats" from the poem and replaced it with "whisker'd vermine-race" (Irlam 390-391).  

56.61n Durante, who was physician to Pope Sixtus Quintus. Castore Durante da Gualdo (1529-1590), botanist and physician to the Popes Gregory XIII and Sixtus V, author of *Herbaria nuovo* (1585) and *Il tesoro della sanità* (1586).  

56.61n straps of cane-rats are publicly sold in the markets of Jamaica. Grainger may have been referring to a passage from Hans Sloane's *A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725) that reads, "Rats are likewise sold by the dozen, and when they have been bred amongst the Sugar-Canes, are thought by some discerning people very delicious Victuals" (1.xx). Sloane seems to imply that all Jamaicans, and not just the enslaved, ate rats.  

57.69 mangrove-banks. Mangroves are trees of the genus *Rhizophora*, which contains well over a hundred species, most native to the Old World but some native to the New. Mangroves can thrive in soils of varying levels of salinity and have colonized tropical and subtropical coastlines to form forests and thickets there. 

57.69 Guayaquil. Gulf and river in Ecuador leading to the city of Guayaquil. The modern name of the river is the Rio Guayas.

57.72 gallinazo. The American black vulture (*Coragyps atratus*), whose native range includes North, Central, and South America. 

57.54 alligators. The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.  

57.75 Ibbos. Igbo refers to a language spoken in the Bight of Biafra (now the Bight of Bonny), a bay on the western Atlantic coast of Africa bounded by Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and northwestern Gabon. The Bight of Biafra was a major slave-trading port in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, and people who spoke Igbo came to be designated as Igbo by slave traders and planters. Some of these people may have thought of themselves as Igbo as well, while others may simply have accepted or been forced to accept the term as a designation, even though they would have identified themselves by their villages or districts of origin instead. Since many people who ended up at the Bight of Biafra and other ports on the western Atlantic coast had made long journeys from inland Africa and picked up various languages along the way, those who identified as Igbo may also have learned Igbo during the process and been participating in what is now sometimes called ethnogenesis or the formation and development of ethnic groupings.  

57.69n Ulloa. Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).  
 
58.83 Misnian arsenic. A chemical compound used as rat poison.  

58.84 cassada. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, a plant that is poisonous to human beings in raw form: its roots contain cyanide. Rats apparently could eat it without being unduly affected, however, since Grainger recommends mixing cassava with Misnian arsenic to poison them. In fact, rats are recognized as major cassava pests today. In spite of their toxicity, cassava roots served as one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, and they were subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. The poison in the roots can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Cassava's advantages are significant enough that they offset its toxic nature: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling.  

58.87 unweeting. Unwitting, ignorant.  

58.88 cates. Choice foods, viands, or delicacies.  

59.95 nightshade's juice. Nightshade most likely refers to *Atropa belladonna*, a poisonous plant also known as deadly nightshade or belladonna. The foliage, fruits, and roots are all highly toxic, and consuming only ten berries could kill a human adult. Its native range extends from England to Iran.  

59.104 thy little gang. Enslaved children. Almost all enslaved persons on the plantation were expected to work, including the young. The tasks children were assigned included weeding, cutting grass to feed the cattle, washing clothes, and serving in the main house.  

59.107 rich manure. Compost.  

59.95n Newman's Chemistry published by Dr. Lewis. William Lewis (bap. 1708-d. 1781) was an English physician and experimental chemist. Author of *Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann, M.D.* (1759). Neumann (1683-1737) was a German chemist.  

59n.Ver.95 East-India. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

59n.Ver.95 Mungoes. The mongoose refers to a small carnivore and member of the family *Herpestidae*. There are many different species of mongoose, all native to the Old World. The mongoose was purposefully introduced to the Caribbean and Pacific islands in the late twentieth century to try and exterminate the rat population. Because the mongoose also eats birds, amphibians, and reptiles, however, it is contributing to the destruction of local biodiversity on those islands and is now considered an invasive species.  

60.114 yellow thistle. Most likely *Argemone mexicana*, the seeds of which are purgative. Also known as the Mexican prickly poppy, native to Mexico and Central America.  

60.116 mountain-dove. May refer to the Zenaida dove (*Zenaida aurita*), a bird native to the Caribbean.

[people] 61.130 Pontus' King. Mithridates (132-63 BCE) ruled Pontus in modern-day Turkey from 120-63 BCE. His attempts to expand his empire led to three wars against the Roman army. Following a mutiny by his troops, he committed suicide.  

61.131 Median climes. Media was the location of hot springs that the Romans called the sacred waters of Hercules.

62.141 poison'd fish. Probably not a specific species of fish, but referring to *ciguatera*, a tropical disease caused by eating large reef fish (like barracuda, snapper, grouper). While the poison does not affect these fish, it accumulates in their flesh when they eat smaller fish that feed on toxic algae. <!-- http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/mfr461/mfr4613.pdf -->

63.171. cochinille. Cochineal (*Dactilopius* coccus). Small scaled insects indigenous to South and Central America. They lay there eggs on the fronds of prickly pear cacti, and dried bodies of the female cochineal produced a crimson dye. Most cochineal production was from Indigenous sources, and the dye became an important Atlantic commodity in the eighteenth century. The red coats of British officers were dyed with cochineal (see lines 174-174 below).  

[plant] 64.172. Indian fig. Prickly pear cactus (*Opuntia ficus-indica*) is native to the Americas. It was the food source for Dactilopius coccus.  

[people] 64.175. British Wolf. James Wolfe (1727-1759), English army officer. Like Grainger, he served in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and during the Scottish Jacobite uprising (1745). Appointed Major-General in North America in 1758, Wolfe is perhaps best known for defeating French General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm and the French army on the Plains of Abraham outside of Quebec city in September 1759.

Perhaps the sugarcane borer (*Diatraea saccharalis*) indigenous to South and Central America. A species of moth whose larvae bore holes in cane plants, it is especially harmful to plantations. (http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/field/sugarcane_borer.htm)  

64.186. Neptune's purifying stream.  Water.  

64.187. Augaean toil. Augeas, king of Elis, owned the stables that Hercules cleaned as one of his twelve labors by redirecting the Alpheus and Peneus rivers. (Brittanica) Here Grainger is comparing the labor of hand-cleaning every leaf in a cane field with the labors of Hercules.

76.429 His father sent him. It was not uncommon for British and Creole planters in the Caribbean to send their children back to the United Kingdom to be educated. Among other things, parents hoped their children would be properly refined and hoped as well that they would escape illnesses associated with the Caribbean (e.g. yellow fever, malaria).
