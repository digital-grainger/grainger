[people] Advertisement. William Shenstone. William Shenstone (1714-1763), English poet and famed innovator of landscape gardening, which he practiced on his estate, The Leasowes. Grainger enclosed a draft of *The Sugar-Cane* in a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, asking him and Shenstone to read and comment on it. He added that "The second book you will see is addressed to our friend at the Leasowes; and I must tell you it is my favourite of the whole" (Nichols 279).  

53.5 For she, poor exile! The opening lines of Book II parallel Grainger's experience in the Caribbean. Having married into a planter family, he felt isolated from his London friends, and he hoped one day to have a plantation of his own, though he never did. Writing to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy on 29 February 1766, Grainger lamented that "I am lost, murdered, for want of company" (Nichols 293).

53.6 no circling mules press dulcet streams. Animals like mules, horses, and cattle were used to power sugar mills if wind and water were not readily available.

53.7 coppers. Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.  

53.9 Vulcan's aid. Roman god of fire. Here, Grainger refers to the use of fire in the process of distilling spirits (rum) from fermented molasses.

54.15 The Boreal morn. The aurora borealis or northern lights.

54.29 "O were my pipe as soft, my dittied song." Gilmore identifies this quotation as an adaptation from Milton's *Comus* (l.86).

55.35 monkey-nation. Monkeys are not indigenous to St. Kitts, but the vervet or African green monkey (*Cercopithecus aethiops*) had been introduced by the seventeenth century. Vervets most likely arrived in the Caribbean via slave ships from Africa. They quickly came to be considered pests because they established themselves in large numbers on the island and traveled around it in troops, raiding colonists' crops. Today, the St. Kitts vervet population exceeds the human one, and vervets are still known for destroying farmers' crops (and stealing tourists' cocktails). Controversially, many of the vervets are now killed or trapped to serve in medical experiments. 

55.38 gambols. Leaps or capers, as made in dancing or playing.  

55.41 thoughtless of to-morrow. Grainger warns that despite the fact that sugar plantations seem like sure investments with guaranteed profits, they nevertheless require expert knowledge and labor to succeed. He wrote *The Sugar-Cane* in part to provide this knowledge.

55.44 Indian crops. Sugar.  

55.46 droles. Also droll, a buffoon or jester. 

[place] 55.46 Liamuiga. Indigenous name for St. Kitts. 

[people] 55.46n Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

56.55 Gallic hosts. Hostile French forces. Here, Grainger makes an analogy between the vervet monkeys and the French during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), the first truly global war that resulted in the establishment of Britain as the preeminent maritime and colonial power.    

56.59 Albion's martial sons. Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

56.62 whisker'd vermine-race. Refers either to the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) or the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), two Old World species of rats that arrived in the Caribbean with colonization and are now considered invasive species. This line of the poem also relates to one of the most famous and perhaps apocryphal stories about the reception and publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. In his *Life of Johnson*, James Boswell recalls a reading of a manuscript draft of the poem that took place at the home of painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The line, "Now, Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. In response, Grainger deleted the word "rats" from the poem and replaced it with "whisker'd vermine-race" (Irlam 390-391).  

[people] 56.64n Durante, who was physician to Pope Sixtus Quintus. Castore Durante da Gualdo (1529-1590), botanist and physician to the Popes Gregory XIII and Sixtus V. Author of *Herbaria nuovo* (1585) and *Il tesoro della sanità* (1586).  

56.64n straps of cane-rats are publicly sold in the markets of Jamaica. Grainger may have been referring to a passage from Hans Sloane's *A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725) that reads, "Rats are likewise sold by the dozen, and when they have been bred amongst the Sugar-Canes, are thought by some discerning people very delicious Victuals" (1.xx). Sloane seems to imply that all Jamaicans, and not just the enslaved, ate rats.  

[plant] 57.69 mangrove-banks. Mangroves are trees of the genus *Rhizophora*, which contains well over a hundred species, most native to the Old World but some native to the New. Mangroves can thrive in soils of varying levels of salinity and have colonized tropical and subtropical coastlines to form forests and thickets there. 

[place] 57.69 Guayaquil. Gulf and river in Ecuador leading to the city of Guayaquil. The modern name of the river is the Rio Guayas.

57.72 gallinazo. The American black vulture (*Coragyps atratus*), whose native range includes North, Central, and South America. 

57.54 alligators. The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.  

57.75 Ibbos. Igbo refers to a language spoken in the Bight of Biafra (now the Bight of Bonny), a bay on the western Atlantic coast of Africa bounded by Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and northwestern Gabon. The Bight of Biafra was a major slave-trading region in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, and people who spoke Igbo came to be designated as Igbo by slave traders and planters. Some of these people may have thought of themselves as Igbo as well, while others may simply have accepted or been forced to accept the term as a designation, even though they would have identified themselves by their villages or districts of origin instead. Since many people who ended up at the Bight of Biafra and other ports on the western Atlantic coast had made long journeys from inland Africa and picked up various languages along the way, those who identified as Igbo also may have learned Igbo during the process and been participating in ethnogenesis (the formation and development of ethnic groupings).  

[people] 57.74n Ulloa. Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).  
 
58.83 Misnian arsenic. A chemical compound used as rat poison.  

[plant] 58.84 cassada. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, is a plant that is poisonous to human beings in raw form: its roots contain cyanide. Rats apparently could eat it without being unduly affected, however, Grainger recommends mixing cassava with Misnian arsenic to poison them. In fact, rats are recognized as major cassava pests today. In spite of their toxicity, cassava roots served as one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, and they were subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. The poison in the roots can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Cassava's advantages are significant enough that they offset its toxic nature: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling.  

58.87 unweeting. Unwitting, ignorant.  

58.88 cates. Choice foods, viands, or delicacies.  

[plant] 59.95 nightshade's juice. Nightshade most likely refers to *Atropa belladonna*, a poisonous plant also known as deadly nightshade or belladonna. The foliage, fruits, and roots are all highly toxic, and consuming only ten berries can kill an adult human. It is native to Europe and Western Asia.  

59.104 thy little gang. Enslaved children. Almost all enslaved persons on the plantation were forced to work, including the young. The tasks children were assigned included weeding, cutting grass to feed the cattle, washing clothes, and serving in the main house.  

59.107 rich manure. Compost.  

[people] 59.95n Newman's Chemistry published by Dr. Lewis. William Lewis (bap. 1708-d. 1781) was an English physician and experimental chemist. Author of *Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann, M.D.* (1759). Neumann (1683-1737) was a German chemist.  

[place] 59.95n East-India. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

59.95n Mungoes. The mongoose refers to a small carnivore and member of the family *Herpestidae*. There are many different species of mongoose, all native to the Old World. The mongoose was purposefully introduced to the Caribbean and Pacific islands in the late twentieth century to exterminate the rat population. Because the mongoose also eats birds, amphibians, and reptiles, it has contributed to the destruction of local biodiversity on those islands and is considered an invasive species.  

[plant] 60.114 yellow thistle. Most likely *Argemone mexicana*, the seeds of which are purgative. Also known as the Mexican prickly poppy; native to Mexico and Central America.  

60.116 mountain-dove. May refer to the Zenaida dove (*Zenaida aurita*), a bird native to the Caribbean. 

[plant] 60.119 knotted grass. Probably *Spigelia anthelmia*, a plant native to Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean that is known for its ability to rid the body of intestinal parasites, including tapeworms.  

60.120 endemial ill. An endemic disease, meaning one that is habitually prevalent in a certain country or locale.  

[plant] 60.123 cow-itch. Cowitch (*Mucuna pruriens*), a viny plant that produces severe itching after contact with skin. Was used on sugar plantations as compost, forage, and cattle feed. Its seeds destroy intestinal parasites. Native to the tropical and subtropical Old World.  

60.114n emetic. A medicine that excites vomiting.  

60.114n dysenteric. Having to do with dysentery or diarrhea.  

[plant] 60.114n ipecacuan. Ipecacuanha, an extract that induces vomiting and that comes from the plant *Carapichea ipecacuanha*, an herbal shrub native to Central and South America.  

60.119n vermifuge. A substance having the power to expel worms from the intestines; an anthelmintic.

[plant] 60.123n English field-pea. *Pisum sativum*, also known as the English pea, garden pea, or green pea. Native to Eurasia.   

60.123n. melasses. Molasses, the thick, brown, uncrystallized syrup drained from raw sugar.  

60.123n *Setae*. Bristles.  

[plant] 61.128 chickweed. *Stellaria media*, a plant native to Europe.  

[plant] 61.129 And that, which coyly flies the astonish'd grasp. Grainger refers to the sensitive plant (*Mimosa pudica*), the leaves of which fold up when touched. It is indigenous to the Americas and became an object of fascination to European naturalists.  

[people] 61.130 Pontus' King. Mithridates (132-63 BCE) ruled Pontus in modern-day Turkey from 120-63 BCE. His attempts to expand his empire led to three wars against the Roman army. Following a mutiny by his troops, he committed suicide.  

61.131 Median climes. Media was the location of hot springs that the Romans called the sacred waters of Hercules.  

[plant] 61.128n Snakeweed. May be *Euphorbia hyssopifolia*, a plant native to the tropical and subtropical Americas.  

61.130n *Mithridatium*. A medicine long believed to be a universal antidote to poison.  

[people] 61.130n Pliny. Gaius Plinius Secundus or Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), author of *Historia Naturalis*.  

61.130n electuary. Medicine in the form of a paste or preserve.  

[people] 62.132 Maro. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Georgics*, and the *Aeneid*.

62.140 Halcyons. Mythical birds usually identified with kingfishers (genus *Halcyon*) that were believed to calm the seas in order to breed in floating nests. The phrase "Halcyon days" previously designated a fourteen-day period around the winter solstice that supposedly was the time when the ocean was becalmed by the birds. It now designates more generally a period of time in the past that was idyllic and peaceful.  

62.141 poison'd fish. Grainger is probably not referring to a specific species of fish but rather to ciguatera, a disease long associated with the consumption of predatory fish in the Caribbean. Ciguatera is a toxin produced by a marine microalgae called *Gambierdiscus toxicus*, and, like mercury, it becomes more concentrated in fish as they rise in the food chain. Symptoms of ciguatera include nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years.  

[plant] 62.148 vervain. Also known as verbena (*Verbena officinalis*), an herbal shrub native to the Old World and Australia.  

[plant] 62.148 wild liquorice. *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration. 

62.149n *Donum Dei*. Gift of god. 

[plant] 62.149n rhubarb. *Rheum rhabarbarum*, a plant native to Asia. Traditionally used for indigestion and bowel complaints; now commonly used as a fruit.  
  
[place] 63.150. Volga's wave. The Volga is a river in western Russia that connects to the Baltic, Moscow, and Black Seas before flowing into the Caspian Sea.  

63.156. insect-tribe. Locusts, one of several species of acridids (family Acrididae) that are known for swarming and migrating and causing great damage to crops.    

63.168 yellow fly. May be *Diachlorus ferrugatus*, a small biting fly native to Central America and the southeastern United States. 

63.171. cochinille. The cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*) is the source of a highly prized red dye made from the dried bodies of the female. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. It became an important Atlantic commodity in the eighteenth century, with most of the supply still coming from indigenous sources. The red coats of British officers were dyed with cochineal.  

[plant] 64.172. Indian fig. Cactus plant of the genus *Opuntia*, some species of which served as food plants for the cochineal insect. There are over a hundred species of *Opuntia* distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* are also known as prickly pear cacti or nopal, the pads and fruit of which are commonly consumed by human beings and animals as food.   

[people] 64.175. British Wolf. James Wolfe (1727-1759), English army officer. Like Grainger, he served in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and during the Scottish Jacobite Rising of 1745. Appointed Major-General in North America in 1758, Wolfe is perhaps best known for defeating French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, marquis de Montcalm, and the French army on the Plains of Abraham outside of Quebec city in September 1759. Wolfe was fatally wounded during the battle, but his victory brought an end to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763).  

[people] 64.176. George. George III (1738-1820), king of Britain from 1760 to 1820.  

64.179. paricides. Father killer. Here, Grainger refers to parasites—and perhaps puns on the similarities between "paracide" and "parasite"—that kill the plants on which they feed (in this case, the sugar cane). Grainger may be referring to the sugar cane borer (*Diatraea saccharalis*), a moth native to South and Central America whose larvae bore holes in sugar cane plants and do great damage on plantations.  

64.187. Augaean toil. Augeas, king of Elis, owned the stables that Hercules cleaned in the course of completing one of his twelve labors. Grainger is comparing the labor of washing every leaf in a cane field with the labors of Hercules, who cleaned the stables by redirecting the Alpheus and Peneus rivers through them.  

[people] 64.171n. Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica. Hans Sloane (1660-1753) was an Irish physician, naturalist, and collector who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 with Christopher Monck, second duke of Albemarle and newly appointed governor of Jamaica. During his stay in Jamaica, Sloane amassed an extensive collection of natural specimens, including plants, that later served as the basis for his natural history, *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). Sloane also succeeded Isaac Newton as president of the Royal Society in 1727. Upon his death, he bequeathed his extensive collections, which he had made considerable additions to after returning from Jamaica, to the British nation. These served as the founding collections of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum in London. Sloane discusses the propagation of cochineal in his *Voyage* (2.208).  

[place] 65.197 men of Kent. Kent is a county in southeastern England.   

65.198 Eurus. In Greek mythology, the east wind.   

65.199 Boreas. In Greek mythology, the north wind. 

65.200 hop-grounds. According to Gilmore, Grainger refers in these lines to the arrival of the hop aphid or Damson hop aphid (*Phorodon humuli*) to Kentish hop fields. These flies traveled on the wind and caused great damage to crops.  

65.201 the blast. Gilmore identifies the blast as the disease that also has been called the black blight. It results from an infestation by the West Indian cane fly (*Saccharosydne saccharivora*).  

65.207 nonage. Period of immaturity.  

[place] 66.217 Virgin-isles. The Virgin Islands are a group of islands situated to the east of Puerto Rico and northwest of St. Kitts. Now divided into the British Virgin Islands and the US Virgin Islands.  

[plant] 66.218 plumb-tree. Plum tree, which could refer to any number of plants of the genus *Prunus*. Plum trees are distributed widely across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.  

66.225 gemmy. Gem-like, brilliant, glittering.  

66.229 the ants' republic. Ant colonies were often represented as model republics in early modern and eighteenth-century accounts because of their ability to work together for the collective good. For example, in his *True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657), Richard Ligon observed that he once put a pot filled with sugar in the middle of a larger dish of water to see whether the ants would be able to find and retrieve the sugar. As he reported, the ants began venturing into the water even though they could not swim, so that their dead bodies could form a bridge for the others to use to access the sugar. The ants thereby "neglect[ed] their lives for the good of the publique" (64).  

66.231 vicegerent. A person appointed by a king or other ruler to act in his place.  

[plant] 66.218n jessamine. Jasmine, plants of the genus *Jasminum* native to tropical and subtropical Eurasia, Australasia, and the Pacific islands. Valued for their scent.  

66.218n panspan <!--I haven't found this term, but it occurs later in book III as well -->

67.232. Rhea. Titan goddess who was the daughter of Gaia and the wife of her brother Kronos. The mother of the second generation of Greek gods, including Zeus, Hera, Demeter, Hades, Hestia, and Poseidon.  

67.233. Auster. Latin name for the south wind.  

67.231n trade-wind. The prevailing wind patterns that eighteenth-century navigators used to sail their ships around the world. In the North Atlantic, the trade winds blow westerly from the coast of Africa just above the equator to the Caribbean and northeasterly from Florida up the coast of North America and toward Europe. 

[people] 67.231n. Homer. Greek poet (8th century BCE), author of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.  

[place] 68.265. Cathäy. The name by which China was known to medieval Europe.   

69.271 hurricane. In a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, Grainger notes that he had almost finished writing *The Sugar-Cane*, and that this set-piece on the hurricane was one of the last sections that needed to be completed: "You may remember I some time ago metioned my being engaged in a work of some length and difficulty. Lately I completed it, at least for the present, though no less than a Georgic, and in four books too. It is called the 'Cane Piece,' and was composed mostly in my rides to the different parts of the island to visit my patients. I now send yo uthe whole; only as I have seen no hurricane, and have not yet had time to arrange my remarks on a fire by night in a cane field, those parts in the second book are incomplete" (*Illustrations*, 278).

69.273 welkin. Sky, firmament.  

[place] 69.278. AEtna. Etna, Europe's highest active volcano, located in Sicily.  

68.287. the Virgin. Virgo, the zodiacal constellation that the sun enters around 20-23 August each year.  
 
68.288. the Scorpion. Scorpio, or the period from late October to late November.  

69.289. Libra. Libra, or the period from late September to late October. Together, these three periods denote peak hurricane season.  

69.290. dome. House.

[plant] 70.294. royal palm-tree's airiest van. Van is a vantage, height, or summit. The royal palm (*Roystonea oleracea*) can reach 40 meters in height and is native to the Lesser Antilles, northern Venezuela, and northeastern Colombia. It also has been naturalized to Guyana, Surinam, and French Guiana.  

70.299 louring. Scowling, angry-looking, gloomy.  
 
70.306 sapient. Knowledgable.  

70. the pole. Polaris, the pole star or North Star.  

71.314-315 strange burs/Surround the stars. A bur or burr is a circle of light surrounding the moon or a star.  

71.322 engineries. Engines of war, artillery.  

71.327-328 "all the isle below is hush as death." According to Gilmore, an approximate quotation of "and the orb below/As hush as death" (Shakespeare, *Hamlet* 2.2.485-486).  

72.341 welkin. Sky.  

[people] 72.349 Theodorus. Perhaps the Samian architect active c. 550–520 BCE.  

72.353 main. The ocean.  

73.356 corruscations. Vibratory or quivering flashes of light; lightning.  

73.367-368 Europe and Asia's vegetable sons...die. Grainger refers to the unsuitability of some Old World plants to the tropical Caribbean climate. Europeans nevertheless transplanted as many familiar Old World plants as they could to the Caribbean and, in doing so, transformed its ecology. They transplanted animals and diseases as well. This transplantation process is now known as the Columbian Exchange, and included the movement of plants, animals, and diseases in both directions across the Atlantic. If the reader consults footnotes about individual plants, it will become apparent how many of the plants Grainger mentions are not native to the Caribbean.  

74.375 sails hang idly. The doldrums, also called intertropical convergence zones where prevailing (or trade) winds disappear, and ships become immobile for days on end.

74.388 Acescent. Sour; acidic.  

74.392 Astonied. This is a typographical error that would be corrected to "astonish'd" in the 1766 London edition of the poem.  

74.392 Solfaterre. A vent where sulfur deposits accumulate. In this case, Grainger means volcanoes.  

74.392n alum. An astringent mineral salt.  

[plant] 75.398 coco. The coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*), which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia. It has great powers of natural disperal since its nuts (the coconuts) can survive up to 120 days in seawater. Nevertheless, it is believed that Europeans introduced the coconut palm to the Caribbean in the sixteenth century.  

75.405 sea-disgorging womb. Grainger is describing a tsunami or tidal wave.  

76.427 Theana. From here to the end of Book 2, Grainger tells the fictional love story of Junio and Theana. The story itself is conventional, borrowing from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*, as well as the story of Inkle and Yarico, first told by Richard Ligon in *A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657) and retold as a sentimental tale in Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's *The Spectator* (No. 11, March 13, 1711).  

76.429 His father sent him from these genial isles. It was common practice for planters to send their children to Britain for education. Many of the children who were sent there, however, never returned to the Caribbean.  

[place] 76.430 old Thames. The Thames river. Here, used to mean England.    

[place] 76.431 Green Eton. Eton, a prestigious English boarding school for boys founded in the fifteenth century.  

76.433 fam'd Isis. Egyptian goddess associated with agriculture and marriage. Isis was eventually apropriated into Greek and Roman mythology, becoming a common figure in eighteenth-century British poetry. In the context of these lines, Isis is used as a name for the Thames as it passes through Oxford.  

76.433 the Nine. The nine muses of art, literature, and science.  

[place] 77.438n Torrid Zone. A theoretical climatic zone lying between between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer; the tropics. The ancients believed that the torrid zone was uninhabitable. While the colonization of the Caribbean proved otherwise, many colonists, naturalists, and others in the eighteenth century continued to believe that the tropics could induce what they called degeneration or the degradation of their bodies and faculties. Furthermore, the fear of degeneration was intertwined with theories of geographic and racial difference, since it was usually argued that New World forms of nature, including human beings, were inferior to Old World ones and that Europeans hence would become inferior themselves by inhabiting the New World.  

77.438n arrack. Also arak, an alcohol distilled from the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).  

[place] 77.438n Oronoko. The Orinoco river, which passes through modern Colombia and Venezuala.  

[place] 77.438n Chili. Chile.  

[place] 77.438n Maldivy Islands. The Maldives archipelago, which is in the Indian Ocean. Now the Republic of Maldives.  

77.438n black sugar. Possibly jaggery, a coarse, dark brown sugar made by evaporation from the sap of various kinds of palm.  

77.438n strong water. Distilled liquor.  

[plant] 77.438n The coco. The coca plant, the source of cocaine. Two species of coca are now in cultivation: *Erythroxylum coca* and *Erythroxylum novogranatense*.  

[plant] 77.438n chocolate-tree. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*), the seeds of which are made into chocolate. The cacao tree is native to Central and South America and has been cultivated by Amerindians for thousands of years. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.
