[plant] 3.1 Cane. *saccharum officinarum*. Tropical grass whose cultivation transformed the globe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Indigenous to Asia, profits from sugar cultivation and refinement in the Caribbean gave rise to the plantation complex and drove the African slave trade. Plantation monoculture had a major impact on local ecologies.

[plant] 6.34 wild red cedar. Probably *Cedrela odorata*, a neotropical species found in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. An important timber tree, now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

[plant] 6.34 locust. *Ceratonia siliqua*, a tree native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Turkey but spread widely over the world. The source of carob, used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.  

[plant] 6.34n white and red [cedar]. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree native to Puerto Rico and widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

[plant] 6.34n cedars cultivated in the Bermudas. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

[plant] 7.36 cassia. Large family of flowering and ornamental trees (*fabacea*), *cassia fistula* and *cassia grandis* werer both introduced to the Caribbean.

[plant] 8.45 sabbaca. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America.
