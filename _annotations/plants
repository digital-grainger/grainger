[plant] 3.1 Cane. *Saccharum officinarum*. A large tufted perennial grass probably native to Southeast Asia and first carried to the Americas by Columbus. By the eighteenth century, widely cultivated on Caribbean plantations by enslaved African laborers so that European and North American consumers could enjoy sugar. 

[plant] 6.34 wild red cedar. Most likely *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. Now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

[plant] 6.34 locust. The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey but now spread widely over the world. It is the source of carob, which is used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.  

[plant] 6.34n white and red [cedar]. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

[plant] 6.34n cedars cultivated in the Bermudas. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

[plant] 7.36 cassia. Most likely *Cassia fistula*, a tree native to India, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia that was being cultivated in the Caribbean by the early sixteenth century. Used as a purgative.  

[plant] 7.36 ceiba. *Ceiba pentandra*, also known as the kapok or silk-cotton tree. Native to Central and South America, the ceiba can achieve a height of 50 meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds.  

[plant] 7.37 guava. Fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, probably native to Central and South America but naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.   

[plant] 7.37 guaiac. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae (Latin for 'wood of life') becuase it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.   

[plant] 8.44 shaddoc. A citrus fruit *Citrus maxima* also known as the pomelo or pummelo. Native to Southeast Asia and known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by a Captain Shaddock.  

[plant] 8.44 forbidden fruit. Refers to species of *Citrus* (family Rutaceae) that are now virtually extinct but perhaps still exist in some parts of the Caribbean. Similar in taste to oranges and shaddocks, closely related to the grapefruit.  

[plant] 8.45 acajou. The cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*), native to Central and South America. While the nut is important to commerce today, the "cashew apple" or receptacle for the nut also was consumed during the eighteenth century. 

[plant] 8.45 sabbaca. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 8.45n two species; the one bearing a green fruit...and the other a red...and grows chiefly in Mexico. There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.  

[plant] 8.45n the pear named Lady's-thighs. Also known as the Cuisse madame or jargonelle pear (*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'). One of the oldest pears in cultivation.  

[plant] 8.45n *Bois d'anise*. French: anise wood. The leaves of some varieties of avocado give off a scent of anise when crushed.    

[plant] 10.45n tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton-plantations. In addition to sugar, tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton were major Caribbean agricultural commodities. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*) is native to the Americas. Indigo (genus *Indigofera*) is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.  

[plant] 14.126 guaiac. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae (Latin for 'wood of life') becuase it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.   

[plant] 14.132 bearded fig. *Ficus citrifolia*, also known as the wild banyan tree, is native to the tropical Americas. It is the national tree of Barbados.

As a food source, it eventually replaced cassava <!--Higman, 73-74--> 

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*) is native to tropical Africa. Although eaten in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, some believed that its taste was too watery and that it could cause stomach problems and even worms.

[plant] 31.420 avocato. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*).  

*[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. See footnote in Book III. It is strange that Grainger would call plantains yellow, though, since enslaved Africans and other eighteenth-century consumers usually preferred them green.

[plant] 31.418n wild pine-apple, or ananas bravo. *Bromelia pinguin*. Found throughout Central America and the Caribbean.

*[plant] 36.520 carnation. Poinciana, flower fence. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*. Schiebinger.

*[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Grainger refers to two kinds, one with sweet fruit and one with sour. He also references the *Opuntia* on which cochineal grows: this is probably *Opuntia ficus-indica*. Finally, he references an *Opuntia* growing in Spain: this could be...
