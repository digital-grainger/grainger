[plant] 3.1 Cane. *Saccharum officinarum*. Tropical grass whose cultivation transformed the globe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Indigenous to Asia, profits from sugar cultivation and refinement in the Caribbean gave rise to the plantation complex and drove the African slave trade. Plantation monoculture had a major impact on local ecologies.

[plant] 6.34 wild red cedar. Probably *Cedrela odorata*, a neotropical species found in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. An important timber tree, now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

[plant] 6.34 locust. *Ceratonia siliqua*, a tree native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Turkey but spread widely over the world. The source of carob, used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.  

[plant] 6.34n white and red [cedar]. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree native to Puerto Rico and widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

[plant] 6.34n cedars cultivated in the Bermudas. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

[plant] 7.36 cassia. Large family of flowering and ornamental trees (Fabacea), *Cassia fistula* and *Cassia grandis* werer both introduced to the Caribbean.

[plant] 7.36 ceiba. *Ceiba petandra*, also known as the silk cotton tree. Native to the Caribbean and important to pre-Columbian indigenous mythology <!-- follow up details on indigenous -->

[plant] 7.37 guava. Fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, which is native to the Americas and was widespread the Caribbean by the eighteenth century (or earlier).   

[plant] 7.37 guaiac. *Guiacum officinate*, or lignum vitae is a tree indigenous to the Caribbean. Guaicum was used medically as a treatment for syphilis in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (the "corrupted love" from line 42 below), and as an abortifacent. 

[plant] 8.44 shaddoc.  *Citrus grandis*, likely imported from South Asia in the seventeenth century by a captain Shaddock <!--Higman 175-->

[plant] 8.44 forbidden fruit. Refers to species of *Citrus* (family Rutaceae) that are now virtually extinct but perhaps exist in some parts of the Caribbean. Similar in taste to oranges and shaddocks, closely related to the grapefruit.  

[plant] 8.45 acajou. The cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*), indigenous to tropical America. While the nut is important to commerce today, the "cashew apple" or receptacle for the nut also was consumed during the eighteenth century. 

[plant] 8.45 sabbaca. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 8.45n the pear named Lady's-thighs. Also known as the Cuisse madame or jargonelle pear (*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'). One of the oldest pears in cultivation, a medium-sized fruit that has yellow-green skin with a reddish flush and some russetting.  

[plant] 10.45n tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton-plantations. Tobacco (*Nicotinia tabacum*), indigo (*Indigofera tinctoria* and *Indigofera sufffructicosa*), coffee (*Rubiaceae* family), and cotton (*Malvaceae* family) were four of the major Caribbean agricultural commodities after sugar. Tobacco is indigenous to the New World, Indigo (used in the production of blue dye) and cotton are found in tropical regions around the world, coffee is indigenous to the Arabian peninsula. 

[plant] 14.126 guaiac. *Guiacum officinate*, or lignum vitae is a tree indigenous to the Caribbean. Guaicum was used medically as a treatment for syphilis in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (the "corrupted love" from line 42 below), and as an abortifacent. 

[plant] 14.132 bearded fig. *Ficus citrifolia*, a large indigenous type of Banyan tree.

[plant] 19.213 lily. Fleur-de-lis, a lily-shaped ornament that symbolizes France.

[plant] 20.234 provender. Generic term for dried cattle feed (e.g. hay).

[plant] 20.237 yams. One of many species of tubers from the *Dioscorea* family. Some are indigenous to the Caribbean, and others from various tropical regions. *Dioscorea trifido* eventually became the dominant species in the Caribbean. As a food source, it eventually replaced cassava <!--Higman, 73-74--> 

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*) is native to tropical Africa. Although eaten in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, some believed that its taste was too watery and that it could cause stomach problems and even worms. The planter and famous English author Matthew Lewis went as far as as to compare its appearance to blood and its taste to "raw flesh." Lewis, *Journal* PAGE. 

[plant] 26.337n cedar. Red cedar (*Cedrela odorata*) has a strong odor.  

[plant] 27.342n mahoe-berry. 

[plant] 29.378 wild fig. Bearded fig (*Ficus citrifolia*), a large indigenous type of Banyan tree.

[plant] 29.393 fern-tree shades. Tree ferns are primitive plants that belong to the order Cyatheales. Grainger may have been referencing *Cyathea arborea*, sometimes known as the West Indian treefern, which can grow up to 9 meters tall.  

[plant] 31.418 anana. The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*), native to eastern South America and brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean.  

[plant] 31.420 avocato. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and other parts of Central America. An important part of the diets of enslaved Africans who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens.  

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus carried sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*).  

[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. See footnote in Book III. It is strange that Grainger would call plantains yellow, though, since enslaved Africans and other eighteenth-century consumers usually preferred them green.   

[plant] 31.418n cherimoya. *Annona cherimola*, a fruit originally from the South American highlands. Its taste has been compared to that of vanilla ice cream.  

[plant] 31.418n wild pine-apple, or ananas bravo. *Bromelia pinguin*. Found throughout Central America and the Caribbean.

Logwood is the commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. *Haematoxylum campechianum* is now widely naturalized in the Caribbean (but not in the 18C, I don't think--check period sources). A source of the dye substance haematoxylin.  

[plant] 35.508 ricinus. Probably *Ricinus communis*, the castor oil plant. 

[plant] 36.510 acassee. acacia. Perhaps *Parkinsonia aculeata* or *Vachellia macracantha*, a flowering thorny plant. Hence the reference to the crown of thorns (ll. 511-12).

[plant] 36.515 privet. Genus *Ligustrum*, invasive shrub commonly used for hedging.

[plant] 36.520 carnation. Poinciana, flower fence. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*. Schiebinger. 

[plant] 36.520n senna. Grainger means a purgative plant, so he means various preparations of the dried fruits of certain shrubs of the genus *Cassia* that work as laxatives.  

[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Grainger refers to two kinds, one with sweet fruit and one with sour. He also references the *Opuntia* on which cochineal grows: this is probably *Opuntia ficus-indica*. Finally, he references an *Opuntia* growing in Spain: this could be...

[plant] 38.538 wild liquorice. 

[plant] 38.536n guava jellies. 

[plant] 38.538n Jumbee Beeds. The plant *Abrus precatorius* is a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment.
