88.12 eldest birth of Time. January.  

88.24 Dryads. Wood or tree nymphs in Greek mythology.  

88.25 broad-leaf'd china. The china-root plant, *Smilax china* L., which is native to China and valued for its medicinal properties. Whether *Smilax china* L. grew in the eighteenth-century Caribbean is unclear, however. The genus *Smilax* today contains approximately 350 species, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Moreover, recent studies of the *Smilax* genus in the Caribbean do not show the presence of *Smilax china* L., although the species *Smilax viscifolia* Duhamel is commonly known as "China root" in Jamaica. Lilian Ferrufino-Acosta, "Taxonomic revision of the genus Smilax (Smilacaceae) in Central America and the Caribbean Islands," *Willdenowia* Bd. 40, H. 2 (December 2010): 227-280.  

88.17n a giant, of that appellation, carrying our Saviour, in the form of a child. A reference to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means 'Christ-carrier,' was a giant who once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river.  

88.25n sarsaparilla. Refers to various species of the genus *Smilax* native to Central and South America. Spanish conquistadors named it *zarzaparilla* and learned from indigenous peoples to use it as an antisyphilitic. Also used to flavor drinks, including root beer in the nineteenth century. Grainger may have been referring to the species *Smilax regelii* Killip & C. V. Morton, commonly known as "Jamaica sarsaparilla."  

88.25n lignum vitae. The hard, dense wood of the guaiacum tree, *Guaiacum officinale* L.

89.31 M***. Grainger is likely referring to Colonel Samuel Martin \(1694/5-1776\), Antiguan-born British plantation owner, author of *Essay upon Plantership*, in which he defends slavery and details a style of plantation management that was considered progressive in his day. It is unclear when the *Essay* was first published, but its revised third edition was issued in 1756, and it underwent several reprints over the next two decades. As a manual that covers sugar-cane production and the management of slaves in the British Caribbean, Martin's *Essay* indeed precedes Grainger's own program in *The Sugar-Cane*.

89.33 spleen. From the Greek *σπλήν* and Latin *splen*, designating bad temper or a melancholy temperament.

89.25n East-Indies. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

89.25n gout. Metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals.

89.25n obstructions. Blocks in any tubular organ or structure, such as an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain.

90.59 Palaemon's fate. Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

90.61 hydra. A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The name has also become a byword for a difficult task.

91.81n Bagasse. The crushed stalks that are the byproduct of milling sugar-cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel and cattle feed.

91.84 Palaemon. See note for [internal] Book III, line 59.

92.99 luscious Cane.  

92.107 AEthiop-brow.  

93.108 Phosphor. The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.

93.118 eyes. Sugar-cane buds. To produce new sugar-cane, stalks of sugar-cane with buds on them were planted in the ground.

94.131 Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Dyer was the rector of the parishes of Coningsby and Kirkby in Lincolnshire when he died.
