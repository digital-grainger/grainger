88.12 eldest birth of Time. January.  

88.24 Dryads. Wood or tree nymphs in Greek mythology.  

88.25 broad-leaf'd china. The china root, *Smilax china* L., is native to China, as Grainger notes; hence the common name. However, approximately 300 species belong to the genus *Smilax* \(family Smilacaceae\), and they are found across tropical and temperate regions of the globe as woody climbing plants. Common species of the genus in central America include *Smilax coriacea* Spreng., *Smilax guianensis* Vitman, and *Smilax oblongata* Sw.; Grainger does not specify the species.

88.17n a giant, of that appellation, carrying our Saviour, in the form of a child. A reference to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means 'Christ-carrier,' was a giant who once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river.  

88.25n sarsaparilla. Dried roots of plants in the American genus *Smilax*. The plant may also occur as a shrub; there are 315 species of plants thus called throughout the tropics and temperate regions. Extracts from the roots of some species are used to make root beer, also called sarsaparilla. The name is an Anglicization of the Spanish name *zarzaparrilia*.

88.25n lignum vitae. The hard, dense wood of the guaiacum tree, *Guaiacum officinale* L.

89.31 M***. Grainger is likely referring to Colonel Samuel Martin \(1694/5-1776\), Antiguan-born British plantation owner, author of *Essay upon Plantership*, in which he defends slavery and details a style of plantation management that was considered progressive in his day. It is unclear when the *Essay* was first published, but its revised third edition was issued in 1756, and it underwent several reprints over the next two decades. As a manual that covers sugar-cane production and the management of slaves in the British Caribbean, Martin's *Essay* indeed precedes Grainger's own program in *The Sugar-Cane*.

89.33 spleen. From the Greek *σπλήν* and Latin *splen*, designating bad temper or a melancholy temperament.

89.25n East-Indies. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

89.25n gout. Metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals.

89.25n sciatica. Irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. Causes severe pain from the lower back to the legs.

89.25n obstructions. Blocks in any tubular organ or structure, such as an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain.

90.59 Palaemon's fate. Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

90.61 hydra. A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The name has also become a byword for a difficult task.

91.81n Bagasse. The crushed stalks that are the byproduct of milling sugar-cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel and cattle feed.

94.131 Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Dyer was the rector of the parishes of Coningsby and Kirkby in Lincolnshire when he died.
