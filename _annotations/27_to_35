27.341n guana, or rather Iguana. A family of lizards (order Squamata, suborder Sauria). More than 700 species are identified today in the family, found principally in the temperate and tropical Americas; they are the New World counterparts of the Agamidae of the Old World, and often have a crest of spines running from the neck to the tail. Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.  

27.341n *Lues Venerea*. The term *lues venerea* was applied during the seventeenth century across Europe for all sexually transmitted diseases, often described as a single ailment. Leonardo Botallo of Paris used the term early on in 1563, as did Jean Fernel in 1579, to name syphilis, or the "French pox," and it remained the popular name for syphilis in the eighteenth century. Until the mid-eighteenth century, European medical thought commonly held that the *lues venerea* originated from a single virus. It was not until the nineteenth century that different kinds of sexually transmitted diseases were distinguished with specific names.

27.342n *cholera morbus*. The term *cholera morbus* is used today for the disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was applied to both cholera and cholera-like diseases.
