105.334 dropsy. Edema, an excessive accumulation of fluid in bodily tissues.  

105.335 boilers, (prime of slaves,). Working conditions in the boiling house were extremely difficult, and only the strongest slaves were assigned there. Tasks included stoking the fires to boil the sugarcane juice and skimming or removing the impurities that rose to the top of the boiling cane juice. Being a boiler was more than merely physical work, however: it also required considerable technical and practical knowledge about the process of sugar production and refinement, and masters depended heavily on their head refiners or boilers for good yields of sugar from their crops.  

105.340 perflation. Ventilation provided by air blowing through a space.

105.347 essential salts. Eighteenth-century scientists studying the composition of plants posited that they contained essential salts or acids and minerals obtained by the crystallization of plant juices.

Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.  

106.350n Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).  

106.357n *Dumb Cane*. *Dieffenbachia seguine*. Native to tropical America, the dumb cane looks very similar to sugarcane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugarcane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours.

107.364. Bristol, Britannia's second mart and eye!. City located in the southwest of England, one of England's most important sugar-refining cities in the eighteenth century. Although the initial steps of sugar production happened in the Caribbean, sugar was further refined in Britain before being sold to consumers there. Bristol became a center for sugar refining in part because it had ample supplies of limestone.  

107.366 "to thy waters only trust for fame." A line from William Whitehead's poem, "An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol Spring" (1751).  

107.371 Avon's. Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from the Warwickshire Avon or Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process. 

108.380 Sabrina. A poetic name for the River Severn, which is Britain's longest river and empties into the Bristol Channel.  

108.381 marble. A metamorphic rock formed by applying great heat and pressure to limestone.

109.412 make labour light. While Grainger recommends letting enslaved Africans drink the sugarcane juice, planters sometimes inflicted severe punishments for eating or consuming sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thsitlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth. Douglas Hall, *In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86* (London: Macmillan, 1989).    

109.413 coppers. Kettles for boiling the juice pressed out of the sugarcanes.

114.504 Pomona. Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit.  

114.507 ebriety. State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.  

114.508 Albion. Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade (for Johnson's exact comment, see the note for [internal] Book IV, lines 74-77). Privately, Johnson and other members of his literary circle also may have found Grainger's attempts to aestheticize subjects related to sugar cultivation ludicrous. For instance, at a reading of *The Sugar-Cane* manuscript that took place at the home of Sir Joshua Reynolds, a well-known painter and close friend of Johnson's, the line, "Now Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. The line does not appear in the published version of the poem.  

114.509 Percy. See note for [internal] Book II, line 452.

114.509 White. The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated May 9, 1801, written to Thomas Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes's *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811. *The Percy Letters: The Correspondence of Thomas Percy and Robert Anderson*, vol. 9, edited by W. E. K. Anderson, Louisiana State University Press, 1944, at pp. 59, 67-68, 269.  

114.510 Calpe. Calpe refers to one of the Pillars of Hercules in Greek mythology, now known as the Rock of Gibraltar.

114.514 Paeon. Paeon, the Greek god of healing, also known as Paean.  

114.510n Mrs. Lennox. Charlotte Lennox (1730/1731?-1804), British writer best known for the novel *The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella* (1752). A close friend of Samuel Johnson.  

115.522 sand-box shade. The sand-box (*Hura crepitans*), a tree native to tropical America.  

115.531 reed-built huts. Dwellings of enslaved Africans.

115.533 With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep. Plantains and bananas both belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that enslaved Africans often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Plantains and bananas were widely consumed by free inhabitants of the Caribbean as well. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

115.522n emetic. A medicine that excites vomiting.  

116.549 tamarinds. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*), native to tropical Africa and western Asia but naturalized to and cultivated in the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.    

116.549 panspans. See note for [internal] Book II, line 218.  

116.549 papaws. Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its exact origins are unknown, but it is most likely from Central or South America.  

116.549n sweet-meats. Preserved or candied fruits.  

116.549n intenerate. To make tender, soften.  

116.549n ringworms. Ringworm, or tinea, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.  

117.550 Iris. Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods.  

117.555 Hesperian throats. "Hesperian throats" refers to the Hesperides, the daughters of Night and Erebus who guarded the tree of golden apples given by Hera to earth, also renowned for their singing. Because the tree was popularly located beyond the Atlas mountains at the western border of the Ocean, Hesperian also means western.  

117.558 herald-lark. Larks may name any of several small birds of the family Alaudidae. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World, larks are also conventionally associated with the dawn.  

117.652 Phoebus. Phoebus, an alternate name for the Greek god Apollo and used in contexts where Apollo is identified with the sun.  

117.549n anthelmintic. Anthelmintic (also anthelminthic, antihelminthic) drugs are used to expel or kill parasitic worms, especially intestinal ones.  

118.570 Deep, moral truths convey. By the time Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane*, there was a long-standing tradition in European literature of using insects to represent moral, religious, and philosophical ideas. Most notably, Virgil's *Georgics* inspired Grainger and other neo-georgic writers to use bees as symbols of orderly plurality.  

118.578 Why will their sons, ungrateful, roam abroad? Grainger refers here either to the common practice of absentee plantership, in which plantation owners lived in Britain and managed their plantations from afar, or to the equally common practice of sending children of planters to Britain for education.  

118.587 Bellona. Bellona, the Roman goddess of war.  

119.592 heaven-favoured bard. Grainger's "heaven-favoured bard" alludes to Tyrtaeus. See note for [internal] Book III, line 600.  

119.593 Sparta's. Sparta was a powerful city-state in ancient Greece.  

119.600 Tyrtaeus. Tyrtaeus, Spartan poet of the mid-seventh century BCE who wrote about the Second Messenian War and exhorted Spartans to fight to the death for their city.  

119.601. cates. See note for [internal] Book III, line 480. 

119.602 pine. Pineapple.  

119.604 Apicius. Apicius, a name used for several Roman connoisseurs of luxury but especially Marcus Gavius Apicius, a gourmet who lived during the reign of Tiberius (CE 14-37). He exhausted his fortune on feasts and committed suicide rather than economize.  

119.608 Jew-fish. Jew-fish, the Atlantic goliath grouper (*Epinephelus itajara*). A large sporting and food fish of warm coastal waters. Its range includes the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Now a critically endangered species. William Dampier first named it in print in his 1697 *Voyages and Descriptions: A Voyage to New Holland*, remarking, "The Jew-Fish is a very good Fish, and I judge so called by the English, because it hath Scales and Fins, therefore a clean Fish, according to Levitical Law." <!--Mention the renaming controversy?->   

119.596n General George Townshend. George Townshend, first Marquess Townshend (1724-1807), an English politician and caricaturist who also had a distinguished military career, serving as second in command to Major-General James Wolfe in Canada during the Seven Years' War and then as overall commander after Wolfe's death during the campaign to take French-held Quebec, which surrendered to British forces in 1759.     

119.598 drive invasion from their native shore. Probably refers to a failed attempt in 1759 by French forces to invade Britain.  

119.608n caramaw. Unidentified.

119.608n camaree. Unidentified.  

120.610 The large, black, female moulting crab. Also known as the mountain crab (*Gecarcinus ruricola*), the black crab is a type of land crab that lives in the woods and higher hills of dry land but travels once a year to the sea to reproduce. Prized as a delicacy.

120.613n Colonel Christopher Codrington, for building a college in Barbadoes, and converting Negroes to the Christian religion. Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born in Barbados and belonged to the wealthy Codrington family, which owned sugar plantations in Antigua and Barbados and leased land in Barbuda. Codrington served as deputy-governor of Barbados and governor-general of the Leeward Islands. At his death in 1710, he bequeathed his Barbados plantations and a share of the island of Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), an Anglican missionary organization that aimed to convert colonial inhabitants, including enslaved and free Africans, to Christianity. In 1745, the SPG opened Codrington College, which initially served only white colonists.  

120.614n the war preceding the last. The War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748), during which a French force unsuccessfully tried to invade Anguilla in 1745.
