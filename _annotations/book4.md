125.1 Genius of Africk. Grainger is using the term "genius" in the sense of a supernatural being or guardian spirit associated with a place, institution, or thing. "Genius of Africk" thus means something like the spirit of Africa.  

125.2 castled elephant. The combination of an elephant and a castle (often with the castle on the elephant's back) is an old heraldic sign.  

[place] 125.4 Niger. The Niger river. One of Africa's largest rivers. Its source lies in modern Guinea, and it empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Nigeria.  

[plant]125.6 Papaw. Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its exact origins are unknown, but it is most likely from Central or South America.

[place]125.9 Rio Grandê. Major estuary in modern day Guinea-Bissau.  

[place]125.9 Sanaga. Most likely the Senegal river, which empties into the Atlantic ocean at St. Louis on Senegal's northern border with Mauritania. There is a Sanaga river that empties into the Gulf of Guinea just south of Douala in modern Cameroon, but this appears to have been called the Cameroon or Camarones river prior to the mid nineteenth century.  

125.11 brede. Braid.  

126.21 Caribbe's. The Caribbean's.   

126.22 parch'd Libya's wilds. Not the modern nation of Libya, but the Libyan desert in the eastern Sahara. Grainger uses "Lybia" and "Lybians" several times in Book IV of *The Sugar-Cane* to signify Africa and Africans.

126.23 bays. Laurel (bay leaf) crown, often associated with poetic achievement.

126.24 Sylvan bard. Literally, poet from the wilderness. Here Grainger seems to be referring to himself insofar as he writing from the Caribbean rather than from metropolitan London.

[person]126.25 Melvil. Robert Melville (1723-1809), Scottish army officer and colonial governor. Like Grainger, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the British army and fighting in the War of Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), he faught in the Caribbean, becoming temporary governor of Guadeloupe after defeating the French, and being named governor of Grenada, the Grenadines, Tobago, Dominica, and St. Vincent in 1764. <!--Julie add something re: St. Vincent-->

126.28 indian wreath. Indian wreath further makes the point that the poem is a product of the Caribbean.  See notes on line 24 above as well as the preface, where Grainger emphasizes the local specificity of *The Sugar-Cane*, and refers to the poem as a West-India georgic.

[plant]126.31 myrtle. Myrtle (*Myrtus communis*) is an aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love.  

127.35 jetty. Jet black. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century British writers often used the term "jetty" or "jet" when describing what they saw as the idealized beauty of exceptional Africans. See, for example, Aphra Behn's *Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave*, where the narrator describes Oroonoko: "his face was not of that brown, rusty black which most of that nation are, but a perfect ebony or polished jet."

127.38-39 In mind, and aptitude for useful toil,/The negroes differ: muse that difference sing. Grainger is taking on the perspective of a slave trader. 

[place]127.44 Congo's wide-extended plains. Kingdom in southwest Africa north of Angola and near the modern Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). <!--Note to Julie: as part of the note on African peoples, we should try to distinguish between nation, kindgom, people, ethnic group, etc. I am not 100% sure of how to do this, but happy to talk about it -->

[place]127.45 long Zaire. Zaire or Congo river. The second longest river in Africa, it drains into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of the DRC.

127.51 mechanic art. Here Grainger recommends that enslaved persons from the Congo be assigned specific trades rather than being forced to work as field laborers.  

127.52 ductile. Malleable; flexible.

[place]128.62 Golden Coast. Term used by Europeans to define one of the four major trading region on the West African coast. Although it is difficult to establish the borders of these regions with exactitude, they included the Grain Coast (roughly corresponding to modern Sierra Leone and Liberia), the Ivory Coast (modern Cote d'Ivoire), the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and the Slave Coast (modern Togo, Benin, and Nigeria). British slaving ships often made port on the Cape Verde islands off the coast of modern Senegal before sailing down the coast of Africa, trading goods along the way. Once they had rounded the Bight of Benin (Bight of Bonny), they followed the equator past the island of Saint Thomas (São Tomé) and toward the Caribbean. It is important to note that people were enslaved and embarked from a much larger region than the Slave Coast itself (ranging from at least Senegal to Angola).

128.63 Papaws. Also Popo. Name of people from the region between Accra in modern Ghana and Ouidah in Benin.

[place]128.65 Volta. Volta river in Ghana, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Accra.  

[place]128.65 Rey. Likely the Rey (or Rio del Rey) estuary in modern Cameroon. It is not clear whether Grainger means a specific river within this estuarial system. 

128.71 oft by suicide. Suicide was prevalent in the Atlantic slave trade. From captivity in Africa to embarkation and transportation across the ocean, to sale and forced labor in the Americas, Europeans commented on and proposed theories about the cause of these suicides. In particular, physicians like Grainger often suggested that suicide by enslaved Africans was caused by physical illness or by melancholy. It should also be noted that European Christians generally considered suicide to be a sin (it was a breach of the sixth commandment forbidding murder), but their concern when it came to the enslaved was almost solely economic, as Grainger suggests in these and later lines. For more on suicide in the Atlantic slave trade, see Snyder (2015).

128.72 gang. Gang was the general term used to designate groups of enslaved persons -- especially field laborers.

128.82 Cormantee. Name given to Fanti people embarked at Fort Kormantse in the modern nation of Ghana. By the mid eighteenth century, the name Cormantee was closely associated with warlike people who resisted enslavement—thus Grainger's warning in these lines. Indeed Grainger would have been most familiar with Tacky's Rebellion, a 1760 uprising led by Cormantee people in Jamaica. The uprising, which occurred less than a year after Grainger had arrived in St. Kitts loomed lage over the remainder of the century, and led to a number of increasingly repressive laws (see notes on obeah and drums, below). For more on Tacky's Rebellion specifically, see: http://revolt.axismaps.com/

128.88 poinard. Dagger. 

128.91 clayey tubes. Pipes.  

[plant]128.94 rice, or yams, or lofty maize. Three major food crops in West Africa. While rice and yams were indigenous to the region. In the context of West African crops, maize either signified American corn *or* sorghum (also called Guinea corn and millet). <!--confirm; do we need scientific names here?-->  

[place]130.99 Minnah. Elmina, a city on modern Ghana's Atlantic coast. It was the first European settlement in West Africa, and a major stop in the Atlantic slave trade.  

130.102 Moco-nation. People from the region between Bonny Island and Calabar on the southeast coast of modern Nigeria. What Grainger calls the Moco-nation here, is in th same region as the Igbo or Ebo people. <!-- https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/794d7o and near bonny here: https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/41t1wo and here: https://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/s/r654yp--> 

130.103 worms. Grainger is referring to parasitic worms (helminths) that live in the digestive tracks of humans and other animals. There are many such parasites, including tapeworms and roundworms. Worms were a major health concern in the eighteenth century, producing physical effects such as malnutrition and anemia as well as cognitive problems.

130.104 Mundingo. Mundingo, Mandingo, or Mandinka were people of the West African interior centering around the modern nation of Mali, but ranging as far as Senegal, Guinea, and Cote D'Ivoire. With respect to religion, the Mandinka are most closely associated with Islam.

130.106 learned leach. Physician.

130.108 Phoebus. Phoebus, an alternate name for the Greek god Apollo and used in contexts where Apollo is identified with the sun. 

130.110 Elysium. Part of the Greek underworld reserved for heroes.  

[place]130.113 Quanza. Cuanzo (or Kwanza) river in modern Angola. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean south of Luanda (known in the eighteenth century as Loango or Loando). This line refers to enslaved people from Angola, who were primarily enslaved by the Portuguese.

130.119 Ethiop. Aethiop and Aethiopia (also Ethiop and Ethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Aethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well.

130.121 Machaon. Greek physician and son of Asclepius, god of healing.  

[plant]130.123 vervain...sempre-vive. *Verbena officinalis* is an herbal shrub native to Europe. *Sempervivum* ("always living"). Plant widely used in medicine, described here by Grainger as a laxative The dried plant is used to make tea. Gilmore notes that Grainger may not have been referring to European vervain, but to *Aloe vera*.

130.127 white eagle. Calomel, or mercuric chloride. Medicine widely used in the eighteenth century for its laxative and purgative effects, also described here by Grainger as a vermifuge.

130.133 The novel gang. Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.

[plant]130.136 acajou. The cashew or cashewnut tree (Anacardium occidentale), native to Central and South America. While the nut is important to commerce today, the "cashew apple" or receptacle for the nut also was consumed during the eighteenth century. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic and is said to have been used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles. See for example Maria Riddell, *Voyages to the Madeira, and Leeward Isles* (Edinburgh, 1792), 82-83.  

[plant] 130.137 cherries. 

132.141 rheums. Mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold, but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illness.  

132.141 dysenteric. Dysentery, a gastrointestinal disorder, remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 

132.142 hydrops. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema).

132.148. leprosy's infectious bane. 

[plant]132n Gum-Arabic. Edible sap from the Acacia tree used as a binder/stabilizer in foods and medicines. Not indigenous to the Caribbean.

132.150 swallow dirt. Geophagy or Pica were the medical terms used for dirt eating. Eighteenth-century physicians and enslavers were fascinated with geophagy, which they believed to be a disorder that led to death. In certain instances, they posited that eating dirt was a mode of committing suicide, and thus a form of enslaved resistance.  There is an ongoing tradition of dirt eating in parts of West Africa.

132.150 Chlorotic fair. Chlorosis (also called green sickness) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

132.137n almond.

132.137n long citron, or amber-coloured, is the best. 

132.146 turtle. 

133.151 cates. Food; victuals. Here Grainger uses it in the sense of "delicacies".

133.156 Paean. Physician of the gods in ancient Greece. Also an alternate name for Apollo.

133.160 provender. Food for cattle.  Especially hay and dried grains.

133.162 made her annual progress. Here Grainger makes a specific recommendation about the "seasoning" process for newly transported enslaved Africans.  Seasoning was the general eighteenth-century term used to describe the period of aclimatization that every person went through when travelling great distances—and especially when moving between radically different climates.  Prevailing climatist medical theories posited a direct relation between health, character, and climate. Physicians believed that patients were more susceptible to illness and death in the weeks and months after they first arrived in new places. This observation was broadly true, but not for reasons of climate; instead, travel across long distances often meant coming into contact with new and potentially fatal diseases. Seasoning was the period of time during which new arrivals were to avoid strenuous activity while they adapted to their new environments. Grainger's recommends that enslaved Africans be seasoned for a year, although this was clearly not a common practice.

133.163 conch. Family of marine molluscs best know for their large shells, which can be used as musical horns when properly blown.  

133.165 Nor, Negroe. This and the following 40 lines are the only in the poem where the narrator addresses the enslaved directly. Despite this direct address, the passage is framed by a set of rhetorical questions that help the planter-enslaver justify his actions to himself. The justifications that follow were standard fare in pro-slavery tracts.  

133.169 dark tartarean caves. Having to do with Tartarus, the part of the Greek underworld reserved for the wicked. Here Grainger refers to the work of miners. Improved technology in the seventeenth century facilitated the construction of deeper coal mines in Scotland, where coal became a major domestic export. The rising demand for coal quickly exhausted accessible deposits, necessitating deeper mines that extended hundreds of feet into the earth.

[place]134.178 Scotia. Scotia, a name for Scotland. Southwestern Scotland had produced lead since the Roman period. The Scottish Habeas Corpus Act of 1701 did not apply to those in servitude in the coal and lead mines of Scotland, who could be bound in serf-like bondage to employers by ancient custom. Such workers could be sold or leased with the undertaking of mining work and were accounted as a part of the inventory. Vagabonds and their families could be seized and returned to work. Born in Scotland himself, Grainger was aware of this history and this vignette draws a deliberate connection bewteen enslaved Africans and the enslaved Scots to mitigate the violence of the African slave trade. It would not be until 1774 that an Emancipation Act forbade mine owners from accepting new servitudes and provided for the emancipation of existing workers who had served for a certain number of years. Only in 1799 were all miners legally freed.  
134.180 palsies. Palsy, paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

[place]134.181 the rocky Drave. As Grainger's footnote to this line explains, the Drave, or Drava, is a river in central Europe. It forms the boundary between Croatia and Hungary. 

134.182 silver's fluent ore. Quicksilver or mercury, which, as Grainger notes, was a major export of the region. Among the effects of continued exposure to mercury are palsies (line 180 above) and loss of teeth (line 193 below).  

134.185 Incas. The Incan empire extended from modern Ecuador to Chile in the early sixteenth century when Spanish conquistadors arrived and imposed colonial rule. In the 15 lines that follow, Grainger relies on the trope of the black legend to suggest that the suffering of the Inca at the hands of the Spanish was far worse than any enslaved African working on a British sugar plantation in the Caribbean could experience. In particular, the silver mines at Potosí in Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) drove Spanish settlement, and indigenous populations were subjected to the *encomienda* system, in which an *encomendero* accepted tribute and obligatory labor from natives in return for protection. In the early seventeenth century this gave way to a *corregimiento* system that established networks of provincial governors who managed the labor distribution and tributary arrangements. Enslaved Africans were also imported and put to work in mines when labor ran short, gradually surpassing the natives in population. Besides silver, gold deposits were found throughout the Andes, from Venezuela to Chile, and European settlers expanded the extant mining work of the indigenous Americans in both scale and productivity.  

134.188 proud insulting tyrants. The Spanish conquistadors

135.204 your pleasing task. The georgic mode is invested in describing the benefits of healthful agricultural labor. It is entirely conventional to describe that labor as "pleasing," but here *The Sugar-Cane* runs into its central ideological paradox: even as Grainger compares plantation slavery favorably to Scottish, Hungarian, and Inca mining, the fact remains that enslaved labor is neither pleasing nor healthful. The georgic convention thus appears highly stylized and ridiculous.

135.207 humours. Moods.  

136.211 let humanity prevail.  From here to the end of *The Sugar-Cane* Grainger settles on a strategy of amelioration through which he accepts the institution of slavery and suggests that treating the enslaved humanely is an economically prudent strategy. Note that his recommendations mirror the actions of Montano at the end of Book I.

136.212 his native land. As with so many other places in the text, Grainger is imagining a fictional person in a generic African space. The repetition of "perhaps" here and in the next 10 lines is intended to invoke sympathy in the reader/planter.

136.213 possest large fertile fields, and slaves. The practice of slavery did exist in Africa, although it is clear that the Atlantic slave trade fundamentally altered how its practice. Grainger's reference to slavery in Africa is a conventional move of pro-slavery writers, who used it in an attempt to justify and excuse the plantation slave system.

[place] 136.215 Indus. Indus, a river in southern Asia, rising in the Kailas mountain range in Tibet and flowing through India and Pakistan.  

136.229 these uninstructed swains. A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. They key figure in georgic poetry.  

136.232 Oh, did the tender muse possess. Grainger claims that he would abolish slavery if his poetry had the power to do so. The next 10 lines are the only explicitly abolitionist sentiments in the poem, and would be quoted positively in abolitionist tracts. See Nathaniel Appleton, *Considerations on Slavery* (Boston, 1767).

137.236 Heart-debasing slavery. Alongside his description of the Cormantee earlier in book IV (lines 82) and his description of slavery's "tyrannic sway" (line 235), this is one of the few clear signals of slavery's evils. In the context of this section, however, Grainger represents that evil as necessary.

137.242 Servants, not slaves. Grainger claims that even after they were freed, formerly enslaved Africans would continue to work on sugar plantations by choice. This is a pro-slavery fantasy.

137.244 Say, shall the muse. The abrubt shift in tone marks Grainger's turn away from his abolitionist fantasy and toward a policy of amelioration in which physicians like himself will play a central role. Recall here his words at the end of the preface: "I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet."  See Thomas, "Doctoring Ideology."

137.246 worm. Guinea worm, or the dragon worm (*Dracunculus medinensNathaniel Appleton], Considerations on Slavery.  In a Letter to a Friend (Boston: Edes and Gill, 1767)is*), is a parasitic nematode acquired by drinking water contaminated by the water flea *Cyclops*, which carries the worm's larvae. The larvae break through the stomach lining and enter the bloodstream, growing to full size within a year. A pregnant female worm lives in connective tissues beneath the skin and eventually will release its larvae into a large blister, usually on the legs or arms. The worm's migration produces symptoms such as itching, giddiness, breathing difficulties, vomiting, and diarrhea. The worm may come out spontaneously with the released larvae, but typically treatment involved attaching the worm to the end of a stick and winding it slowly out of the opening in the skin over the course of several days—this is the "leaden cylinder" that Grainger mentions in line 252. A broken worm causes an extreme allergic reaction that can be fatal, and blisters on the skin may ulcerate and become infected, resulting in an abscess and the "annual lameness" of which Grainger warns in line 255. Today the worm may also be treated through anthelmintics.  

137.255 Moor. Moor, a name for a native or inhabitant of Mauretania in North Africa, which corresponds to present-day Morocco and Algeria. 

138.256 dragon worm. *Dracunculus medinensis*) from line 246 above. 

138.257 fell, winged insects. Chigres or Chegoe (*Tunga penetrans*), species flea indigenous to Central and South America. As Grainger describes in his note, this parasitic insect embeds itself and lays its eggs in the flesh of humans. Like the Guinea worm, Chegoes were both horrifying and fascinating to European observers, who described them in detail. One such important description occurs in Richard Ligon, *A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657), where an enslaved indigenous woman named Yarico is praised for her skill in removing chegoes. This same Yarico came to be extremely famous in the eighteenth century via the story of *Inkle and Yarico*.

138.258 sable. Black.

138.265 yaws. Yaws, or *frambesia tropica* is an extremely contagious skin infection caused by the *Treponema pallidum* spirochete. Physicians associated it primarily with enslaved Africans, although Europeans and creoles were also subject to infection. In its early stages, yaws produces skin lesions and ulcers, but can become debilitating if left untreated for a period of years. By the late eighteenth century, Europeans began to associate severe cases of yaws with obeah men. See Bejamin Moseley *A Treatise on Sugar* (1799).

138.267 conchs.  

138.268 The flowers of sulpher, and hard niccars. The Knicker nut (*Guilandina bonduc* or *Caesalpineae bonduc*) tropical flowering legume.

138.268n farinaceous. Consisting or made of flour or meal, starchy.

139.271 ichor. In Greek mythology, the ethereal fluid believed to have flowed through the veins of the gods. 

139.276 live-silver. Mercury (or quicksilver), when taken as mercuric chloride (calomel) and important purgative in eighteenth-century medicine. Could also cause excessive salivation (as in line 277) 

139.282 defoedations. The action of contaminating, polluting, or infecting something, especially the blood or skin. In this case, the period eruption of yaw sores.

[plant] 139.283 turpentine and guaiac pods. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae (Latin for 'wood of life') becuase it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both Guaiacum officinale and Guaiacum sanctum are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.

139.287 might not skill ingraft. Grainger wonders whether inoculation might not be a good way to fight yaws. Popularized in Europe and the Americas as a treatment against smallpox in 1722, inoculation involved puncturing the skin of a healthy individual, and deliberately infecting him or her with pustulent matter from smallpox patient. Extremely dangerous by modern standards because the inoculee came down with smallpox, inoculation nevertheless had a much lower rate of mortality than being infected by smallpox in the "natural way." Inoculation did not work for inoculation.

140.291 worms tyrannize.  Grainger's use of the term "tyrannize" here is an echo of lines 188 and 235. Here, however, Grainger displaces the earlier tyranny of slavery onto the insect world, which thus becomes the primary tyrannical foe of the enslaved.

140.291 Proteus-like. In Greek mythology, Proteus, an old man and shepherd on the island of Pharos near Egypt, was able to shape-shift. The worms' ability to cause multiple maladies and symptoms is equated to Proteus's shape-shifting abilities.

140.296 Mania. Roman and Etruscan goddess of the dead who ruled the underworld with Mantus.

140.300 Ague. An acute or high fever, or a disease that causes such. Often used to refer to malaria. 

140.305 "melt with the minings of the hectic fire." Gilmore identifies this line as an adaption from John Armstrong's description of a lung infection in *The Art of Preserving Health* (1744).

140.309 cow-itch. Cowitch (*Mucuna Puriens*) an invasive vine that produces severe itching after contact with skin. Was used for composting, cattle fodder, and in medicine as a vermifuge.

140.310 melasses. Molasses, the by-product of refining sugar cane.

141.312 vermifuge. Vermifuge, or anthelmintic drugs, are used to eliminate parasitic worms in the body.

141.313 worm-grass. <!--Gilmore notes that this is knotted grass; copy from bk II when note is done-->

[place] 141.317 Cornish mine. Places of tin deposits in Cornwall and the surrounding areas in western Britain. Grainger notes that tin acts as a vermifuge.

[place] 141.319 Tyrians. Inhabitants of Tyre, town on the Mediterranean coast in southern Lebanon. It was a major Phoenician seaport for trade between 2000 BCE through the Roman period.

[place] 141.323 Attic's sterile land. Attica, the ancient district of east-central Greece, its chief city being Athens. Maritime trade far surpassed its agriculture.   

[people] 141.317n Strabo. Strabo (64 BCE - 21 CE), Greek geographer and historian whose work *Geography* outlined the countries and peoples of the Greco-Roman world under the reign of Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE).

141.317n Phaenicians. 

[place] 142.330 Enna. City and province in central Sicily, headquarters of a Sicilian slave revolt (134-132 BCE).

[place] 142.330 Belgian fens. Refers to the High Fens, a highland plateau in the eastern Belgian province of Liege. 

142.334 shake off the tyrannic yoke. The region Grainger refers to as the Belgian fens had been part of the Netherlands, which were under Spanish control from the sixteenth century until the War of Spanish Succession in the early eighteenth century. After the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the Spanish ceded the Netherlands to Charles VI of Austria.

142.345 Sylvanus. Commonly spelled Silvanus, the Roman god of the countryside that is often associated with woodlands and agriculture.

142.346 Ceres. The Italo-Roman goddess of food growth, often worshipped in conjunction with the Earth goddess Tellus.

[place] 143.353. white Albion. Derived from the Latin word for white, Albion refers to Great Britain, potentially referencing the white cliffs of Dover.

143.356. main. Main refers to the open sea. Here, Grainger refers to Britain as the ruler of the sea. See, for example, the eighteenth-century poem by James Thomson, "Rule, Britannia!"

143.359 Eurus. In Greek mythology, the East Wind.

[people] 143.360. Columbus. Christopher Columbus (1450/1451-1506). Sailed to the Caribbean islands on a voyage thought to be a route to Asia sponsored by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. Columbus made three such voyages, establishing a colony at Hispaniola where he served as governor before he was briefly imprisoned for violent and incompetent governance.

[place] 143.363. Lusitania's. A Roman province named for its inhabitants, the Lusitani. Modern-day Portugal.

143.369-370 bewitch'd; and whom/In wrath, a conjurer's snake-mark'd staff hath struck!. A reference to obeah, a set of Afro-Caribbean medicinal and religious practices. Colonial descriptions of obeah vary from magic to superstition to folk medicine. (general outline drawn from *Atlantic Studies* vol. 12 no. 2 "Obeah: knowledge, power, and writing in the early Atlantic World"). Colonial writers describe enslaved persons using plants or herbs to heal sickness or bring the dead back to life as well as deploying charms to defend against bullets or death, among other uses. Most accounts register the rebellious nature of these practices, and Grainger's poem was published in the aftermath of a large, coordinated 1760 rebellion in Jamaica that involved approximately 1,500 enslaved persons in which obeah played a particularly important role. (see Vincent Brown's http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html) 

143.370n negroe-conjurers, or Obia-men. By calling the obeah men conjurers, Grainger casts doubt on their abilities. A conjurer could refer to a magician or wizard, but it also could refer to someone who was merely pretending to perform miracles.  

144.377 drowth. Dryness, thirst.  

144.381. sacred nine. The nine muses of art, literature, and science.  

[place] 144.370n Guinea. A region on the west coast of Africa that served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade. Included parts of modern-day Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Not to be confused with the modern nation of Guinea on the western coast of Africa.  

144.370n they can also do good on a plantation, provided they are kept by the white people in proper subordination. Interestingly, Grainger admits that obeah men were not merely conjurers or individuals pretending to have special spiritual powers. Indeed, obeah men also and perhaps even primarily served as healers and thereby filled an important gap on plantations, where medical care was infrequently provided to the enslaved by planters themselves.    

148. serpent's head. In addition to referring to a set of practices and beliefs, "obeah" also could refer to a charm that would protect or curse an individual. These charms were often made up of a combination of materials, such as the one's listed here by Grainger, that were believed to have spiritual or sacred significance.  

148.391 phial. Vessel for holding liquid.  

148.391 leach. Physician.  

145.394-395 to poison they are infamously prone. While colonial accounts of obeah assume that the charms and potions made up by obeah men were meant to do harm, it is likely that obeah practitioners saw themselves as channeling supernatural or spiritual forces for beneficial ends, including healing or protection.  

145.406. Lucifer. Also known as Phosphorus. In Greek mythology, the bringer of morning light.

146.407. rushy couch. A bed made from stiff and hollow plants.  

146.410 broom-bush. Gilmore identifies this as possibly *Sida acuta*, a plant with yellow flowers that open in the morning. Native to Central America.  

146.414 jalap, or marvel of Peru. *Mirabilis jalapa*. Also known as the four o'clock flower because its flowers open in the afternoon. Probably native to Mexico; used by the Aztecs as an ornamental. Sometimes believed to be native to the Peruvian Andes because it was exported from that region to Europe in the 1500s.  

146.415 solanum. *Datura stramonium*, also known as fireweed or jimsonweed. Probably native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.  

146.415n. Linnaeus...Dr. Stork. Carolus Linnaeus or Carl von Linné (1707-1778) was a Swedish naturalist who laid the foundations for modern taxonomy or the systematic classification of living organisms. He also established a system for naming organisms known as binomial nomenclature. Dr. Stork was Anton von Störck (1731-1803), a physician from Vienna known for his research on poisonous plants.  

[people] 147.424 Ethiop. Ethiop and Ethiopia (also Aethiop and Aethiopia) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Ethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Ethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Ethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.  

147.430 Deny subsistence to their labouring slaves. Grainger addresses the fact that planters regularly provided plantation laborers with insufficient provisions to economize on costs. At the same time, planters did not engage in the large-scale cultivation of provision crops on Caribbean lands because they wanted to dedicate all fertile land to sugar. As a result, although they were required to work full-time producing sugar and other commodity crops, enslaved laborers frequently were required to tend provision gardens or plots of land upon which they cultivated food crops to supplement the provisions provided by planters. The lands allotted for provision grounds were generally rocky, mountainous plots with poor soil. 

[plant] 147.434 English beans, or Carolinian rice. Beans or peas, as they were often called in the Caribbean, were a major source of nutrition for the enslaved. English beans are also known as fava, broad, or horse beans (*Vicia faba*), which originated in Western Asia thousands of years ago and spread from there to Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. They were sometimes sent from England to the Caribbean to serve as provisions. They also formed part of the provisions of slave ships. The horse bean was not as central to the diets of the enslaved as other bean species, however, many of which were cultivated by the enslaved themselves. Rice also did not make up a major part of the diets of the enslaved, but South Carolina was the major Atlantic exporter of the rice species known as *Oryza sativa*, which originated in Asia. There is also a species of rice indigenous to Africa known as *Oryza glaberrima*. Enslaved persons occasionally may have grown both *Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima* in their provision grounds and gardens, but it never was a major source of subsistence.  

147.435 Iërne's beef, or Pensilvanian flour;. Iërne is a term for Ireland, which supplied Caribbean plantations with salted beef and other provisions. Beef also came from the North American colonies, as did flour. 

147.436 Newfoundland cod, or herrings from the main. The waters off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic constituted one of the major fisheries of the world for the Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) in the eighteenth century. Planters imported cod for enslaved laborers, who needed protein to function, but they imported what came to be known as "West India cod," which was salted cod of the poorest quality.  

148.448 This let them cultivate, one day, each week. Enslaved laborers generally were required to go to their provision grounds one day per week to tend them. In certain colonies, however, an internal marketing system gradually emerged that may have encouraged some to spend extra time cultivating their provision grounds. For instance, in Jamaica, those who participated in the system were able to sell or trade their provisions for other goods and currency. They were also able to supplement the inadequate diet provided to them by planters, although those individuals who cultivated provision grounds did not enjoy, on average, better health or longer lifespans than those dependent primarily on imported rations. Still, the provision grounds did offer their cultivators some control over what they ate, as they were responsible for choosing what plants to cultivate, and, in limited cases, they also offered some degree of economic autonomy. They also laid the foundation for agricultural production in the British Caribbean in the years following emancipation. Eschewing the model of industrial agriculture represented by the plantation, the newly freed turned instead to small-scale farming.  

[plant] 148.449 And there raise yams. Yams, one of many species of tuber within the *Dioscorea* genus, were widely cultivated in provision grounds, in part because they did not require regular care to thrive. There are several other reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. 

[plant] 148.449 and there cassada's root. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era and subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well, although it was not as important a food source as the yam. Nevertheless, it still appeared in provision grounds because it is an easy crop to cultivate: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. These advantages offset cassava's toxic nature: its roots, which are the parts of the plant prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw roots are poisonous to human beings. The poison can be neutralized by proper processing, however: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads.  

[plant] 148.454-455 There let angola's bloomy bush supply, For many a year, with wholesome pulse their board. Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of the enslaved because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

[plant] 148.456 bonavist. A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) native to Cape Verde, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.  

[people] 148.449n Ogilvy's America. John Ogilby's *America: being the latest, and most accurate description of the New World* (1671). Ogilby (1600-1676) was a Scottish publisher and geographer.   

[plant] 149.457-458 ochra...slimy pulp...help disdains. Okra (*Abelmoschus esculentus*) is native to tropical Africa and was one of the most commonly cultivated plants in the provision grounds and gardens of the enslaved. It possesses a glutinous or slimy pulp that was used as a thickener in stews called pepper pots, one of the most popular dishes in the colonial Caribbean.  

[plant] 149.459-460 potatos...Sweet as the cane-juice is the root they bear. Grainger refers to sweet potatoes (*Ipomoea batatas*), not to be confused with potatoes (*Solanum tuberosum*) or yams (genus *Dioscorea*). The sweet potato is native to Central America or northwestern South America but had spread to the Caribbean islands by the time of Columbus' first voyage. It was an important food crop for Amerindians.  

[plant] 149.461 eddas. Edda or eddo commonly referred to taro (*Colocasia esculenta*). It also sometimes referred to yautia (*Xanthosoma sagittifolium*), however. Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by the enslaved because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. *Colocasia esculenta* is native to Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 CE. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* is native to Central and South America.  

[plant] 149.462 Indian cale, and foodful calaloo. The term "Indian cale" also can refer to the species *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. Since the seventeenth century, "callaloo" has been used to refer to several different plants. Today, callaloo usually refers to *Amaranthus viridis*, a plant native to the tropical Americas. What the various plants labeled callaloo had in common was the ability of their leaves to serve as edible greens. They are also weedy plants that can survive in a wide range of environments, including wastelands. They formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved, probably because they are a hardy and reliable source of food.  

[plant] 149.463 mint. Plants of the genus *Mentha*, distributed around the world.  

[plant] 149.463 thyme. Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeast tropical Africa.

149.462n esculent. Suitable for food, edible.  

[plant] 150.468 gold fruit mature. Grainger refers here to various citrus trees, which originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the lime (*Citrus aurantifolia*) and the citron (*Citrus medica*).

[plant] 150.471 coffee. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[plant] 150.474 cocô. Another term for cacao. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

150.474 thy rich pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

150.475 Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require. Cacao trees take several years to produce pods that can be harvested.  

150.476 Ere the stone grind them to the food of health. Cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts, are ground up to produce chocolate, which was branded as early as the seventeenth century as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is also possible that maroons living in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food (Hughes, *The American Physitian* 131).    

[plant] 150.478-479 And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd, With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;. Madre de Cacao (*Gliricidia sepium*). Native to Central and South America, used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.

[people] 150.485 negro-fugitives. Runaway or escaped slaves.  

[place] 151.488 Indian gardens. Early colonial reports from the Caribbean describe flourishing Amerindian gardens. Amerindians generally practiced conuco or mound cultivation, in which various crops were intercropped or cultivated together in ecologically sustainable fashion.  

[place] 151.489 Phaeacia's isle. Scheria, the island that Odysseus arrives at after his shipwreck, home of the Phaeacians. Whether Scheria corresponds to a real place is unclear, however.

[plant] 152.512 tamarind...With those tart fruit the sweltering fever loves To quench his thirst, whose breezy umbrage soon Shades the pleas'd planter, shades his children long. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*) was native to tropical Africa and western Asia but naturalized to and cultivated in the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

[plant] 152.513 cassia. Most likely *Cassia fistula*, a tree native to India, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia that was being cultivated in the Caribbean by the early sixteenth century. Used as a purgative.

[plant] 152.502n The English commonly call it *Mammey-sapota*. There are two species of it, the sweet, and the tart. Mammee sapota (*Pouteria sapota*) is commonly confused with the mammee apple. It is a sweet fruit native to Mexico and Central America. Another fruit commonly confused with the mammee apple and mammee sapota is the nasebery (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the sapodilla or the nispero. It is a sour or tart fruit native to Mexico, Central America, and Colombia.
