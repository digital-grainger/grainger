87.7 wide-cultured plains. Cultivated fields; a sign of civilization after spending time in the wilderness.

88.12 eldest birth of Time. January.  

88.24 Dryads. Wood or tree nymphs in Greek mythology.  

[plant] 88.25 broad-leaf'd china. The china-root plant, *Smilax china*, which is native to China and valued for its medicinal properties. Whether *Smilax china* grew in the eighteenth-century Caribbean is unclear, however. The genus *Smilax* today contains approximately 350 species, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Moreover, recent studies of the *Smilax* genus in the Caribbean do not show the presence of *Smilax china*, although the species *Smilax viscifolia* is commonly known as "China root" in Jamaica.  

88.17n a giant, of that appellation, carrying our Saviour, in the form of a child. A reference to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means 'Christ-carrier,' was a giant who once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river.  

[plant] 88.25n sarsaparilla. Refers to various species of the genus *Smilax* native to Central and South America. Spanish conquistadors named it *zarzaparilla* and learned from indigenous peoples to use it as an antisyphilitic. Also used to flavor drinks, including root beer in the nineteenth century. Grainger may have been referring to the species *Smilax regelii*, commonly known as "Jamaica sarsaparilla."  

[plant] 88.25n lignum vitae. The hard, dense wood of the guaiacum tree (*Guaiacum officinale*) used in the treatment of syphilis and yaws.

[people] 89.31 M * * * . Colonel Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. The *Essay* described Martin's methods of sugar planting, as well as proposals for improving or making sugar cultivation more efficient, and served as an important source for Grainger. <!---Not clear; Gilmore suggests that it could be Mathew, Grainger's brother-in-law--->  

89.33 spleen. Bad temper or a melancholy temperament.  

[place] 89.25n East-Indies. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

89.25n gout. Metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals.  

89.25n palsy. Paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

89.25n sciatica. Irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. Causes severe pain from the lower back to the legs.  

89.25n obstructions. Blocks in any tubular organ or structure, such as an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain.  

90.48 swains. A country of farm laborer, a shepherd. The key figure in the georgic. Contrast with IV.229, where Grainger refers to enslaved laborers as swains.

90.54 nor hand of malice. Arson. Grainger does not specify who the arsonists might be, but this is one of the places where he hints at moments of enslaved resistance on Caribbean plantations.

90.59 Palaemon's fate. Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

90.61 hydra. A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The term also signifies a difficult task. Grainger uses it here to describe the difficulty of putting out fires once they break out. 

91.80 cypress-roofs <!--clearly some kind of thatched roof, but not sure if it's actual cypress; Gilmore thinks no-->

91.81n Bagasse. The crushed stalks that are the byproduct of milling sugar-cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel and cattle feed.  

92.94 coppers. Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.

92.99 dare now deprive them of the luscious cane. In his prose *Essay on the More Common West-India Diseases* (1764), Grainger writes that enslaved Africans "should not only be allowed to drink what quantity of the cane-juice they think proper, but even be obliged to drink it" during crop time.

92.103 wanes. a Wane (or Wain) is a large open vehicle or wagon drawn by horses or oxen and used to carry heavy loads, especially of agricultural produce

92.103 many a day, And many a night. Cane juice begins to spoil as soon as the plant is cut, so planters preferred to have their mills and boiling houses run 24-hours a day during harvest time. Grainger's reference to "cheerful toil" in line 101 is ironic under any circumstance, but especially during crop time, which was well considered the most laborious and difficult time of the year.

92.107 AEthiop-brow. Aethiop and Aethiopia (also Ethiop and Ethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Aethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Aethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference and African inferiority based on skin color.  

93.108 Phosphor. The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.  

93.112 yellow jointed canes. Sugarcane turns yellow when it is ripe.

93.118 eyes. Sugar-cane buds. To produce new sugar-cane, stalks of sugar-cane with buds on them were planted in the ground.  

93.127 junks. Stems or stalks, a gathering of stalks.  

[people] 94.131 Lincoln-plains...Lincoln...Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). The Lincoln longwool is a breed of sheep known for its copious and heavy white wool.

94.135 impress upon their captive sides, their master's cypher. The practice of branding sheep. <!--note re branding the enslaved? Gilmore hints at this via another scholar -->

94.148 hind's blithe whistle. A hind is a farm servant or agricultural laborer.  

[place] 95.153 Annan's pastoral hills. The Annan is a river in Dumfries and Galloway, a unitary council area in southern Scotland near the border with England. During the 1332 Battle of Annan at the outset of the Second war of Scottish independence, Sir Archibald Douglas attacked Edward Balliol and his troops at Annan. Balliol fled to England.

95.160 Ceres. Italo-Roman goddess of growth and agriculture.

95.162 sonorous bellows. Bagpipes.

95.164 dog-star. The dog star is another name for Sirius, brightest star in the constellation Canis Major (Latin for "the greater dog"). Sirius rises in conjunction with the sun, July 3 through August 11.

95.168 off the member snapt. As Grainger describes, milling cane was a dangerous activity and it was not uncommon for enslaved millers to catch body parts between the rollers. Whether mills were powered by wind, water, or muscle, it was unlikely that the rollers could be stopped instantaneously. Instead, the injured were encouraged to have an axe with which to cut off the injured limb ready at hand.

95.168n put out of the wind. To put a windmill "out of the wind" is to stop the mill by turing the sails so they no longer catch the wind.

96.173 manumit. To free from slavery. Here Grainger criticizes planters who manumit (and therefore send off) any person who was too old or too injured to work. Such a manumitted person would be left to care for him or herself.

[people] 96.168n Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), Dominican missionary who worked in Guadeloupe for several years and authored the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).  

96.168n domestic slavery. Refers to slavery within Africa.  <!--I'm not sure that this is right, given the context. cs -->

97.183 the least admixture. The contamination of good cane juice with spoiled juice.

97.189 in huge casks steept. Grainger speaks of adding milled cane, which still has sugary residue, to fermentation vats before composting it. B

97.191 Vulcan's aid. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. Grainger refers to flame being used in the distillation of rum.

97.192 Amphitryte. Also Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon and a sea goddess. In his note, Grainger describes the benefit of adding seawater to rum during the distillation process.

97.196 Nepenthe. From Book 4 of Homer's *Odyssey*, Nepenthe was a drug that made Helen forget her sorrow.

97.197 Polydamna. Wife of Thone, an Egyptian king. In Homer's *Odyssey*, Polydamna gives Helen nepenthe, a drug that soothes grief.  

97.203 Less-bellying canvas. A sail designed so that it does not overfill with wind. Here Grainger returns to the image of the windmill from line 81, above.

[plant] 98.205 coco. The coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).  

98.209 "Informer of the planetary train." The informer is the sun and the planetary train is the movement of the planets across the sky. Gilmore identifies the source of this quotation as George Thomson *The Seasons*

98.215 Lacquay. Also lackey, a footman.  

[place] 98.222 Antigua. One of the Leeward Islands that lies just to the east of Saint Kitts. Antigua was colonized by the English in 1632 and now forms part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda. Samuel Martin, whom Grainger praises in his preface to the poem, was an Antigua planter who published his *Essay on Plantership* around 1750.

98.222n hogsheads. A hogshead was a large cask used to hold and ship sugar. One hogshead of sugar weighed about 1500 lbs.

[place] 98.222n body-ponds. A watershed in Antigua.

99.229 cubit. An ancient measurement of length derived from the forearm, usually about 18-22 inches.  

99.233 worm. *Teredo navalis* or the naval shipworm is a mollusc that burrows into underwater timbers like piers and ships.  

[plant] 99.235 British oak. Also English oak (*Quercus robur*) long used in British shipbuilding. The naval shipworm was particularly destructive to oak.

99.238 bridge-tree. An adjustable beam that supports the spindle of the runner or upper stone in a grain mill.

100.246 sweeps. Arms attached to and driving the central shaft of the mill.  

100.252 lead-lin'd spouts. Much of the plumbing involved in sugar production and distillation was made of (or lined with) lead. A common side effect of excessive rum consumption in the eighteenth century was lead poisoning, which often manifested itself with severe stomach aches (called dry gripes or colic)

100.253 depurated. To depurate is to free from impurities or to cleanse.  

100.255 muscovado. A dark brown, unrefined sugar that was typically the end product of the boiling process in the Caribbean. Often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further and lightened in color before being sold to consumers in Britain.  

100.256 staunchions.  Also stanchion, an upright bar, stay, prop, or support.  

100.256 Day's bright god. The sun.  

[place] [people] 42.599. Virginia. Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) English courtier during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, explorer, and author who obtained a patent for and helped organize the expedition to Roanoke in 1585 and again in 1587. He set out for South America in 1595, exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela, and again in 1617 to search for the famed city of El Dorado. He was executed for treason in 1618. Raleigh is the author of *Discoverie of large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana* (1596), and is associated with the introduction of tobacco to England (his "pungent plant").

[people] 100.259n Sebastian Cabot. Sebastian Cabot (c. 1481/2–1557), Italian navigator and cartographer who explored the north Atlantic and traveled down the northeastern coast of North America, perhaps as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 1508-1509.

[place] 102.283n Havannah. Havana, the capital of Cuba, which the British took in 1762 during the Seven Years' War.  

[plaec] 103.306-307 Kent...Gaul. Kent is a county in southeastern England facing France, which was part of the ancient region of Gaul.  

104.315 boilers. Working conditions in the boiling house were extremely difficult, and only the strongest of the enslaved were assigned there. Tasks included stoking the fires to boil the sugarcane juice and skimming or removing the impurities that rose to the top of the boiling cane juice. Being a boiler was more than merely physical work, however: it also required considerable technical and practical knowledge about the process of sugar production and refinement, and enslavers depended heavily on their head refiners or boilers for good yields of sugar from their crops.  

104.318 Cancer. A constellation seen in early in the Northern Hemisphere. Cancer is also a water sign and a cardinal sign of the Zodiac that indicates a change of season.  

104.321 lave. To pour out.

104.322 gelid. Cold.  

104.323 chemist. The roots of chemistry go back millenia, but modern chemistry came into being betwee the late seventeenth and late eighteenth centuries. Grainger does not mean chemist in the way that a modern audience does, but someone who is skilled in the art of mixing compounds. Sugar production depended on precise technical knowledge about how much to heat the cane juice, at what temperature to do so, and when to add catalysts and additional ingredients.

105.334 dropsy. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema)  

105.334 pulmonic ails. Lung infections/diseases

105.340 perflation. Ventilation provided by air blowing through a space.  

105.345 mucilage. a viscous liquid made from plant material

106.352 acor. Acidic or sour substance.  

106.350n arrack. An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).  

106.350n *pocula morte carent*. The cups contain no death (i.e., the poison is harmless). <!--Alternate translations: There is no death in the cup, Your drinks are free from death-->  

106.350n it forthwith bursts it. The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.  

[people] 106.350n Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).    

[plant] 106.357n *Dumb Cane*. *Dieffenbachia seguine*. Native to tropical America, the dumb cane looks very similar to sugarcane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugarcane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours.  

[people] 106.357n A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time. Thomas Trapham, author of *A Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica* (1679).

107.361 cades. Casks or barrels.  

107.363 lime-stone thoroughly calcin’d. Limestone is a rock that yields lime when calcined or burnt. Lime was used in Grainger's time to refine sugar: when boiled with sugar, lime precipitates impurities.  

[place] 107.364. Bristol, Britannia's second mart and eye!. City located in the southwest of England, one of England's most important sugar-refining cities in the eighteenth century. Although the initial steps of sugar production happened in the Caribbean, sugar was further refined in Britain before being sold to consumers there. Bristol became a center for sugar refining in part because it had ample supplies of limestone.  

107.366 "to thy waters only trust for fame." A line from William Whitehead's poem, "An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol Spring" (1751).  

[place] 107.371 Avon's. Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from the Warwickshire Avon or Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process.  

[place] 108.380 Sabrina. A poetic name for the River Severn, which is Britain's longest river and empties into the Bristol Channel.  

108.381 marble. A metamorphic rock formed by applying great heat and pressure to limestone.  

108.395 Danae. Daughter of King Acrisius of Argos and Queen Eurydice, also mother of Perseus by Zeus, who impregnated Danae in the form of a shower of gold.  

[place] 109.401 Bermuda's. Bermuda, colonized by the English in the early seventeenth century and now an overseas territory of Britain in the North Atlantic Ocean.  

[people] 109.402 Waller's. Edmund Waller (1606-1687), English poet and politician, author of "The Battle of the Summer Islands" (1645), a mock-heroic set in Bermuda.  

[plant] 109.403 their cedars. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

109.412 make labour light. While Grainger recommends letting enslaved Africans drink the sugarcane juice, planters sometimes inflicted severe punishments for eating or consuming sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thsitlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth. Douglas Hall, *In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86* (London: Macmillan, 1989). See also line 99, above. <!--conform citation to our style-->  

109.417 trade-wind. The prevailing wind patterns that eighteenth-century navigators used to sail their ships around the world. In the North Atlantic, the trade winds blow westerly from the coast of Africa just above the equator to the Caribbean, and blow northeasterly from Florida up the coast of North America and toward Europe. 

110.434 coction. Boiling, cooking.  

110.428n melasses. Also molasses, the thick, brown, uncrystallized syrup drained from raw sugar.  

111.441 noble wine. Rum.  

[place] 111.443 Ganges. Also Ganga, a river that flows through India and Bangladesh.  

112.457 fraudful. Grainger criticizes the French who doctor their sugar by adding sand to it and therefore increasing its weight at sale.

112.463 Avaro's. A mean-spirited, rich man who appears as a character in Richard Steele's *The Tatler* (1709-1711). Avaro is Latin for greedy, or miserly. 

[place] 112.476 Thame. The Thames, another major site for sugar refining in the eighteenth century.  

112.477 skimmings. The thick syrup or scum produced during the sugar-boiling step of refining.  

113.480 cates. Choice foods, viands, or delicacies.  

113.482 Baynard. Also bayard. A bay horse or mule.

114.500 toil a pleasure seems. The theme of pleasurable labor is central to the georgic. Here Grainger's narrator experiences labor as pleasurable after he has drunk rum which is an end product of enslaved labor. Contrast this to the ironic descriptions of pleasurable labor in Book IV.   

[place] 114.501 Marne. French tributary of the Seine that flows through northeastern France. the Marne flows through the Champagne region, where wines have been made since the Roman era. Most Champagnes were still until the mid nineteenth century.

[people] 114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade (for Johnson's exact comment, see the note for [internal] Book IV, lines 74-77).

[people] 114.509 Percy. Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811). English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger's, best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*.

[people] 114.509 White. The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated May 9, 1801, written to Thomas Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes's *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811. *The Percy Letters: The Correspondence of Thomas Percy and Robert Anderson*, vol. 9, edited by W. E. K. Anderson, Yale University Press, 1944, at pp. 59, 67-68, 269.  <!--conform to citing convention-->

115.519 rude lays. Unskilled poetry.

[plant] 115.522 sand-box shade. The sand-box (*Hura crepitans*), a tree native to tropical America. It gets its name from its seed pods which, when dried, were used as sandboxes for blotting ink. Apart from being quite tall (100+ feet), the sand-box is peculiar for two other reasons: its leaves, bark, and sap are poisonous, and when ripe, its seed pods open with loud explosive sound, flinging its seeds at over 100 mph.

115.531 reed-built huts. Dwellings of enslaved Africans.  

[plant] 115.533 With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep. Plantains and bananas both belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that enslaved Africans often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Plantains and bananas were widely consumed by free inhabitants of the Caribbean as well. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

115.522n emetic. A medicine that produces vomiting.

It should be noted that Grainger himself looked down upon creoles when he lived in St. Kitts. Writing to his friend Percy on 5 June 1762, Grainger noted that "reading ... is the least part of a Creole's consideration. It is even happy if they can read at all; Spell few of them can; and when they take up a book, modern romance, magazines or newspapers are the extent of their lucubrations" (*Illustrations*, 278).

In these final lines of Book III, Grainger compares the Caribbean to Europe, and enjoins scientists and natural philosophers to explore and learn about the New World's vast natural resources. As he does in his preface to the poem, he suggests that the pursuit of knowledge is a good in its own right, and ought to supplant the more mundane pursuit of wealth.
