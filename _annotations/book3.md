87.7 wide-cultured plains. Cultivated fields.  

88.12 eldest birth of Time. January.  

88.24 Dryads. Wood or tree nymphs in Greek mythology.  

[plant] 88.25 broad-leaf'd china. The china-root plant, *Smilax china*, which is native to China and valued for its medicinal properties. Whether *Smilax china* grew in the eighteenth-century Caribbean is unclear, however. The genus *Smilax* contains approximately 350 species, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Today, the species *Smilax viscifolia* is commonly known as "China root" in Jamaica.  

88.17n a giant, of that appellation, carrying our Saviour, in the form of a child. A reference to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means "Christ carrier," once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river.  

[plant] 88.25n sarsaparilla. Refers to various species of the genus *Smilax* native to Central and South America. Spanish conquistadors named it *zarzaparilla* and learned from indigenous peoples to use it as an antisyphilitic. Also used to flavor drinks, including root beer in the nineteenth century. Grainger may have been referring to the species *Smilax regelii*, known as "Jamaica sarsaparilla."  

[plant] 88.25n lignum vitae. The hard, dense wood of the guaiac tree (*Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which are found in the Caribbean). Lignum vitae ("wood of life") was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws.  

89.30 January, Hail! The new year was generally considered crop time, a period of intense activity when cane was harvested, milled, and prepared for export.  

[people] 89.31 M * * * . Colonel Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. Published in at least a dozen editions before the end of the eighteenth century, the *Essay* contained Martin's recommendations for plantation management and covered topics ranging from the regulation and management of enslaved labor to the planting and harvesting of cane. The *Essay* is written in prose, but it served as an important source for Grainger.  

89.33 spleen. Bad temper or a melancholy temperament.  

[place] 89.25n East-Indies. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

89.25n gout. Metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals.  

89.25n palsy. Paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

89.25n sciatica. Irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. Causes severe pain from the lower back to the legs.  

89.25n obstructions. Blocks in any tubular organ or structure, such as an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain.  

89.38 sylvan school. Informal education provided by experience in nature or the wilderness, rather than in the classroom.

90.46 labour in a round revolves. Cane cultivation is a year-round affair that nevertheless has distinct rhythms, which arise from the fact that cane can take 15-24 months to mature.  

90.48 swains. A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. A key figure in georgic poetry.  

90.54 nor hand of malice. A reference to arson. Grainger does not specify who the arsonists might be, but this is one of the places where he hints at moments of enslaved resistance on Caribbean plantations.  

90.59 Palaemon's fate. Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

90.61 hydra. A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The term also signifies a difficult task.  

91.81n Bagasse. The crushed stalks that are the byproduct of milling sugar-cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel to boil cane syrup and as cattle feed.  

92.92 sail-clad points. Windmill sails.

92.94 coppers. Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.

* 92.99 dare now deprive them of the luscious cane. In his prose *Essay on the More Common West-India Diseases* (1764), Grainger writes that enslaved Africans "should not only be allowed to drink what quantity of the cane-juice they think proper, but even be obliged to drink it" during crop time. However, planters sometimes inflicted severe punishments when the enslaved ate or consumed sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thsitlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth (Hall 73).  

92.103 wanes. A wane is a large open vehicle or wagon drawn by horses or oxen and used to carry heavy loads, especially of agricultural produce.

92.103 many a day, And many a night. Cane juice begins to spoil as soon as the plant is cut. As a result, planters preferred to run their mills and boiling houses 24 hours per day during crop time.  

92.107 AEthiop-brow. Aethiop and Aethiopia (also Ethiop and Ethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Aethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Aethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.  

93.108 Phosphor. The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.  

93.112 yellow jointed canes. Sugar cane turns yellow when it is ripe.

93.118 eyes. Sugar-cane buds. To produce new sugar cane, sugar cane stalks with buds on them were planted in the ground.  

93.127 junks. A gathering of stems or stalks.  

[place][people] 94.131 Lincoln-plains...Lincoln...Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Lincoln was a center of wool production, and the Lincoln longwool is a breed of sheep known for its copious and heavy white fleece.

94.135 impress upon their captive sides, their master's cypher. The practice of branding sheep. Alhough he does not make an explicit comparison between the treatment of animals and human beings, this passage recalls the fact that enslaved persons were branded with the marks of their enslavers. See Gilmore, who credits Tobias DÃ¶ring with this insight.  

94.143 from such dire sounds. The sound of the whip cracking. This is one of several places in the poem where Grainger shrinks from the violence of plantation slavery.  

94.146 laughing, labouring, singing throng. Grainger refers here to the common practice of enslaved laborers singing while working in the cane fields. The songs were sung in part to help establish a rhythm and pace for the work being performed, and planters also saw them as helping to lighten the burden of the labor being performed. In short, they saw music and singing as making work more pleasant and thereby ensuring compliance with the regime of plantation discipline. At the same time, the songs sung during field work often seem to have contained coded or even overt criticisms of planters and plantation discipline. For example, the Gloucestershire Archives in Britain recently uncovered an eighteenth-century slave song from Barbados that contained the lyrics, "Massa buy me he won't killa me/Oh_ Massa buy me he won't killa me/Oh Massa buy me he won't kill a me/Oh 'for he kill me he ship me regular" (see "Song of slaves in Barbados" at https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/archives/learning-for-all/online-exhibitions/inhuman-traffic/). A recording of the song by the Christ Faith Tabernacle of Gloucester also highlights the song's minor key, which imbues it with a sorrowful and tragic dimension (see https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/media/2126/song_48_1mp3-15777.mp3).  

94.148 hind's blithe whistle. A hind is a farm servant or agricultural laborer.  

[place] 95.153 Annan's pastoral hills. The Annan is a river in Dumfries and Galloway, a unitary council area in southern Scotland near the border with England. During the 1332 Battle of Annan at the outset of the Second War of Scottish Independence (1332-1357), Sir Archibald Douglas attacked Edward Balliol and his army at Annan. Escaping just before being captured, Balliol is said to have fled naked to England.

95.160 Ceres. Italo-Roman goddess of growth and agriculture.  

95.162 sonorous bellows. Bagpipes.  

95.164 dog-star. The dog star is another name for Sirius, brightest star in the constellation Canis Major. Sirius rises in conjunction with the sun from July 3 to August 11, which are known as the "dog days" of summer.  

95.167 steel-cas'd cylinder. Grinders in sugar mills tended to be vertical cylinders that crushed cane stalks as they were turned.

95.168 off the member snapt. Milling cane was a dangerous activity, and it was not uncommon for enslaved millers to catch body parts between the rollers. Whether mills were powered by wind, water, or muscle, it was unlikely that the rollers could be stopped instantaneously. Instead, planters were encouraged to supply their mills with axes so that injured limbs could be cut off without delay.  

95.168n put out of the wind. To put a windmill "out of the wind" is to stop the mill by turning the sails so they no longer catch the wind.  

96.173 manumit. To free from slavery. Here, Grainger criticizes planters who manumit the enslaved who are too old or too injured to work. Implicit in this criticism is that such manumitted persons, though free, were abandoned to care for themselves.

[people] 96.168n Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), Dominican missionary who worked in Guadeloupe for several years and authored the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).  

97.183 the least admixture. The contamination of good cane juice with spoiled juice.  

97.189 in huge casks steept. Grainger speaks of adding milled cane, which still contains residual sugar, to fermentation vats before sending them to compost.

97.191 Vulcan's aid. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. Grainger refers to flame being used in the distillation of rum.

97.192 Amphitryte. Also Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon and a sea goddess. In his note, Grainger describes the benefit of adding seawater to rum during the distillation process.

97.196 Nepenthe. From Book 4 of Homer's *Odyssey*, Nepenthe was a drug that made Helen forget her sorrow.

97.197 Polydamna. Wife of Thone, an Egyptian king. In Homer's *Odyssey*, Polydamna gives Helen nepenthe.  

97.198 Jove. Alternate name for Jupiter, Roman god of thunder.

97.198 Helen. Said to be the most beautiful woman in Ancient Greece. Paris abducted her from King Menelaus, thus leading to the siege of Troy.

97.203 Less-bellying canvas. A sail designed so that it does not overfill with wind.  

[plant] 98.205 coco. The coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia. It has great powers of natural disperal since its nuts (the coconuts) can survive up to 120 days in seawater. Nevertheless, it is believed that Europeans introduced the coconut palm to the Caribbean in the sixteenth century.  

98.209 "Informer of the planetary train." The informer is the sun, and the planetary train is the movement of the planets across the sky. Gilmore identifies the source of this quotation as James Thomson's *The Seasons* (1730).  

98.215 Lacquay. Lackey, footman.  

[place] 98.222 Antigua. One of the Leeward Islands; St. Kitts lies just to the west of it. Antigua was colonized by the English in 1632 and now forms part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.  

98.222n hogsheads. A hogshead was a large cask used to hold and ship sugar. One hogshead of sugar weighed about 1500 lbs.  

[place] 98.222n body-ponds. A watershed in Antigua.

[plant] 99.233-236 worm...British oak...The closer calaba. The naval shipworm (*Teredo navalis*) is a mollusc that burrows into underwater timbers on piers and ships. It was particularly destructive to the British or English oak (*Quercus robur*), which was long used in shipbuilding, including by the British navy.    

99.238 bridge-tree. An adjustable beam that supports the spindle of the runner or upper stone in a grain mill.

100.246 sweeps. Arms attached to and driving the central shaft of the mill.  

100.252 thro'. The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "thro'" should read "through."  

100.252 lead-lin'd spouts. Much of the plumbing involved in sugar production and distillation was made of (or lined with) lead. A common side effect of excessive rum consumption in the eighteenth century was lead poisoning, which often manifested in severe stomach aches (dry gripes or colic).  

100.253 depurated. To depurate is to free from impurities or to cleanse.  

100.255 muscovado. A dark brown, unrefined sugar that was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. Often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Britain and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.  

100.256 staunchions. Also stanchion, an upright bar, stay, prop, or support.  

[people] 100.259n. Sir Walter Ralegh. Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) was an English courtier during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, as well as an explorer and author who obtained a patent for and helped to organize the expeditions to Roanoke in 1585 and 1587. He set out for South America in 1595, exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela, and again in 1617 to search for the famed city of El Dorado. He was executed for treason in 1618. Raleigh is the author of *Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana* (1596) and is associated with the introduction of tobacco to England.  

[people] 100.259n Sebastian Cabot. Sebastian Cabot (c. 1481/2â1557), Venetian navigator and cartographer who explored the north Atlantic and traveled down the northeastern coast of North America, perhaps as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 1508-1509. Also led an expedition in 1526 that was supposed to reach Asia but went no further than Brazil. Cabot's place of birth is unclear. Although generally acknowledged as Venice, it might also have been Bristol (late in life, Cabot himself claimed to have been born in Bristol).  

[people] 101.259n King Henry VII. Henry VII (1457-1509) was the first Tudor king of England. He succeeded Richard III, ending the Wars of the Roses, and was himself followed by his son, Henry VIII.

[place] 103.306-307 Kent...Gaul. Kent is a county in southeastern England facing France, which was part of the ancient region of Gaul.  

104.315 boilers. Working conditions in the boiling house were extremely difficult, and only the strongest of the enslaved were assigned there. Tasks included stoking the fires to boil the sugarcane juice and skimming or removing the impurities that rose to the top. Being a boiler was more than merely physical work, however: it also required considerable technical and practical knowledge about the process of sugar production and refinement, and enslavers depended heavily on their head refiners or boilers for good yields of sugar from their crops.  

104.318 Cancer. Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-June and exits it in mid-July. Cancer is also a water sign and a cardinal sign of the zodiac that indicates a change of season.  

104.321 lave. To pour or ladle out.  

104.322 gelid. Cold.  

104.323 chemist. The roots of chemistry go back millenia, but modern chemistry came into being between the late seventeenth and late eighteenth centuries. When Grainger refers to a chemist, he does not mean a modern chemist but someone who is skilled in the art of mixing compounds. Sugar production depended on technical knowledge about the heating of sugar, as well as about the addition of catalysts and additional ingredients to the cane juice to rid it of impurities.  

105.334 dropsy. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema).

105.343 experiment. Experience

105.345 mucilage. a viscous liquid made from plant material

105.347 essential salts. Eighteenth-century scientists studying the composition of plants posited that they contained essential salts or acids and minerals obtained by the crystallization of plant juices.  

106.352 acor. Acidic or sour substance.  

106.350n arrack. An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).  

106.350n *pocula morte carent*. The cups contain no death (i.e., the poison is harmless). <!--Alternate translations: There is no death in the cup, Your drinks are free from death-->  

106.350n it forthwith bursts it. The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.  

[people] 106.350n Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrÃ©gÃ©e d'un voyage fait dans l'intÃ©rieur de l'AmÃ©rique mÃ©ridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a lâÃ©quateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *RelaciÃ³n histÃ³rica del viage a la AmÃ©rica meridional* (1748).    

[plant] 106.357n *Dumb Cane*. *Dieffenbachia seguine*. Native to tropical America, the dumb cane looks very similar to sugarcane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugarcane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours.  

[people] 106.357n A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time. Thomas Trapham, author of *A Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica* (1679).  

[people] 106.307n Charles II. King Charles II (1630-1685), king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, son of Charles I (1600â1649) and brother of James II (1633â1701). He became king after the rule of Oliver Cromwell, and the restoration of British monarchy in 1660.

106.357n alcalescent. Also alkalescent. Tending to become alkaline (having a pH greater than 7).  

[people] 107.359 Xantippe. Also Xanthippe. Wife of Socrates (5thâ4th c. BCE), often described as bad-tempered.  

107.361 cades. Casks or barrels.  

107.363 lime-stone thoroughly calcinâd. Limestone is a rock that yields lime when calcined or burnt. Lime was used in Grainger's time to refine sugar: when boiled with sugar, lime precipitates impurities.  

[place] 107.364. Bristol, Britannia's second mart and eye!. City located in the southwest of England, one of England's most important sugar-refining cities in the eighteenth century. Although the initial steps of sugar production happened in the Caribbean, sugar was further refined in Britain before being sold to consumers there. Bristol became a center for sugar refining in part because it had ample supplies of limestone.  

107.366 "to thy waters only trust for fame." A line from William Whitehead's poem, "An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol Spring" (1751).  

[place] 107.371 Avon's. Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from the Warwickshire Avon or Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process.  

[place] 108.380 Sabrina. A poetic name for the River Severn, which is Britain's longest river and empties into the Bristol Channel.  

108.381 marble. A metamorphic rock formed by applying great heat and pressure to limestone.

[place] 109.401 Bermuda's. Bermuda, colonized by the English in the early seventeenth century and now an overseas territory of Britain in the North Atlantic Ocean.  

[people] 109.402 Waller's. Edmund Waller (1606-1687), English poet and politician, author of "The Battle of the Summer Islands" (1645), a mock-heroic set in Bermuda.  

[plant] 109.403 their cedars. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*). Endemic to Bermuda and used for building houses and other construction work. Also sustained a ship-building industry that denuded the island of most of its Bermuda cedars by the 1830s.  

109.412 make labour light. While Grainger recommends letting enslaved Africans drink the sugarcane juice, planters sometimes inflicted severe punishments for eating or consuming sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thsitlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth. Douglas Hall, *In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86* (London: Macmillan, 1989). See also line 99, above. <!--conform citation to our style-->  

109.415 choral song <!--this one is complicated, but I feel like we should probably add a note about music/singing; it appears several times in book III-->

109.417 trade-wind. The prevailing wind patterns that eighteenth-century navigators used to sail their ships around the world. In the North Atlantic, the trade winds blow westerly from the coast of Africa just above the equator to the Caribbean and northeasterly from Florida up the coast of North America and toward Europe. 

110.425 weighed. The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "weighed" should read "weigh'd."  

110.434 coction. Boiling, cooking.  

110.428n melasses. Also molasses, the thick, brown, uncrystallized syrup drained from raw sugar.  

111.441 noble wine. Rum.  <!-- not 100% sure about this; if they mean fermented but undistilled molasses drink, it isn't rum yet. can't find anything in the notes or in Gilmore, though-->

[place] 111.443 Ganges. Also Ganga, a river that flows through India and Bangladesh.  

112.457 fraudful. Grainger criticizes the French who doctor their sugar by adding sand to casks, thereby increasing their profits.

112.463 Avaro's. A mean-spirited, rich man who appears as a character in Richard Steele's *The Tatler* (1709-1711). Avaro is Latin for greedy, or miserly.

114.500 toil a pleasure seems. The theme of pleasurable labor is central to the georgic. Here Grainger's narrator experiences labor as pleasurable after he has drunk rum which is an end product of enslaved labor. Contrast this to the ironic descriptions of pleasurable labor in Book IV.   

[place] 114.501 Marne. French tributary of the Seine that flows through the Champagne region in northeastern France. Wines have been made there since the Roman era, but most Champagnes were still wines until the mid nineteenth century, when sparkling wines became popular.

[place] 114.501 Tille. A river in Burgundy, a major wine-producing region in France.

114.507 ebriety. State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.  

[place] 114.508 Albion. Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

[people] 114.509 Johnson. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). He made contributions to and edited various periodicals, including *The Gentlemans' Magazine* and the *Literary Magazine*. Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade. Johnson writes: "the poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation ... [and] proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference a groom would give instructions for chusing a horse." For an example of the descriptiosn to which Johnson objected, see Book IV, lines 72-118 below.

[people] 114.509 Percy. Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811). English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger, best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*.

[people] 114.509 White. The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated 9 May 1801, written to Thomas Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes's *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811. *The Percy Letters: The Correspondence of Thomas Percy and Robert Anderson*, vol. 9, edited by W. E. K. Anderson, Yale University Press, 1944, at pp. 59, 67-68, 269.  <!--conform to citing convention-->

115.519 rude lays. Unskilled or unrefined poetry.

[plant] 115.522 sand-box shade. The sand-box (*Hura crepitans*) is a tree native to tropical America. It gets its name from its seed pods which, when dried, were used as sandboxes for blotting ink. Apart from being quite tall (100+ feet), the sand-box is peculiar for two other reasons: its leaves, bark, and sap are poisonous, and when ripe, its seed pods open with loud explosive sound, flinging its seeds at over 100 mph.

115.531 reed-built huts. Dwellings of enslaved Africans.  

[plant] 115.533 With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep. Plantains and bananas both belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that enslaved Africans often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Plantains and bananas were widely consumed by free inhabitants of the Caribbean as well. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

115.522n emetic. A medicine that produces vomiting.  

[plant] 116.549 tamarinds. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*), native to tropical Africa and western Asia but naturalized to and cultivated in the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

116.549 panspans. See note for [internal] Book II, line 218.   <!--needs to be added here and in 2.218-->

[plant] 116.549 papaws. Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its exact origins are unknown, but it is most likely from Central or South America.  

116.549n sweet-meats. Preserved or candied fruits.  

116.549n intenerate. To make tender, soften.  

116.549n ringworms. Ringworm, or *tinea*, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.  

117.550 Iris. In Greco-Roman mythology, Iris was the daughter of the Titan Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, and sometimes cited as the wife of Zephyrus the West Wind. Her name in Greek means "rainbow." The goddess Juno took her to serve as her handmaid. 

117.555 Hesperian throats. "Hesperian throats" refers to the Hesperides, the daughters of Night and Erebus who guarded the tree of golden apples given by Hera to earth, also renowned for their singing. Because the tree was popularly located beyond the Atlas mountains at the western border of the Ocean, Hesperian also means western. When referring to a specific geographic location, it designates Italy or Spain.

117.556 vernal. Of the spring.

117.558 herald-lark. Larks may name any of several small birds of the family *Alaudidae*. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World, larks are also conventionally associated with the dawn.

117.549n anthelmintic. Anthelmintic (also anthelminthic, antihelminthic) drugs are used to expel or kill parasitic worms, especially intestinal ones.  

118.570 Deep, moral truths convey. By the time Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane*, there was a long-standing tradition in European literature of using insects to represent moral, religious, and philosophical ideas. Most notably, Virgil's *Georgics* inspired Grainger and other neo-georgic writers to use bees as symbols of orderly plurality.  

118.573 mountain-dove. May refer to the Zenaida dove (*Zenaida aurita*), a bird native to the Caribbean.

118.578 Why will their sons, ungrateful, roam abroad? Grainger refers here either to the common practice of absentee plantership, in which plantation owners lived in Britain and managed their plantations from afar, or to the equally common practice of sending children of planters to Britain for education.  

118.585 Eclips'd by titles. Despite the practice of absentee plantership, Grainger notes that metropolitan British attitudes toward creoles was inevitably condescending, regardless of how wealthy a planter was.  It should be noted that Grainger himself looked down upon creoles when he lived in St. Kitts. Writing to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy on 5 June 1762, Grainger noted that "reading, I assure you, is the least part of a Creole's consideration. It is even happy if they can read at all; Spell few of them can; and when they take up a book, modern romance, magazines or newspapers are the extent of their lucubrations" (*Illustrations*, 278).

118.587 Bellona. Bellona, the Roman goddess of war. Once again, Grainger is referencing the Seven Years' War.

118.590 Taber. A one-handed snare drum often played as a military instrument.

[plant] 119.602 pine. The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*), which is native to eastern South America. It was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean.

[people] 119.604 Apicius. Apicius, a name used for several Roman connoisseurs of luxury but especially Marcus Gavius Apicius, a gourmet who lived during the reign of Tiberius (CE 14-37). He exhausted his fortune on feasts and committed suicide rather than economize.  

119.608 Jew-fish. Jew-fish, the Atlantic goliath grouper (*Epinephelus itajara*). A large sporting and food fish of warm coastal waters. Its range includes the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Now a critically endangered species. William Dampier first named it in print in his 1697 *Voyages and Descriptions: A Voyage to New Holland*, remarking, "The Jew-Fish is a very good Fish, and I judge so called by the English, because it hath Scales and Fins, therefore a clean Fish, according to Levitical Law." <!--Mention the renaming controversy?-->   

119.598 drive invasion from their native shore. Probably refers to a failed attempt in 1759 by French forces to invade Britain.

[place] 120.612 Scotia's. Scotia is the Latin name for Scotland.  

[plant] 120.612 thyme. Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeast tropical Africa.

[people] 120.613n Colonel Christopher Codrington, for building a college in Barbadoes, and converting Negroes to the Christian religion. Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born in Barbados and belonged to the wealthy Codrington family, which owned sugar plantations in Antigua and Barbados and leased land in Barbuda. Codrington served as deputy-governor of Barbados and governor-general of the Leeward Islands. At his death in 1710, he bequeathed his Barbados plantations and a share of the island of Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), an Anglican missionary organization that aimed to convert colonial inhabitants, including enslaved and free Africans, to Christianity. In 1745, the SPG opened Codrington College, which initially served only white colonists.  

120.614n the war preceding the last. The War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748), during which a French force unsuccessfully tried to invade Anguilla in 1745.  

121.631 "Stage above stage, in various verdure drest." The source of this quotation is not clear.

121.637 "For naught is useless made." Gilmore identifies John Philips's *Cyder* as the source of this quotation. In these final lines of Book III, Grainger compares the Caribbean to Europe, and enjoins scientists and natural philosophers to explore and learn about the New World's vast natural resources. As he does in his preface to the poem, he suggests here that the pursuit of knowledge is a good in its own right, and ought to take precedence over the more mundane pursuit of wealth.
