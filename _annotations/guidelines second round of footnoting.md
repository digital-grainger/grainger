# Guidelines for the second round of footnoting

Please pay attention to the below issues as you complete the second round of footnoting. Also keep the following questions in mind throughout the process:  

Why is this footnote/information being included?   

Is this information necessary to include?  

Is this footnote/information helping my reader to understand the poem better?  

## See if you would add any footnotes to the ones the first person did

Go through the pages of the poem you have been assigned and see if there are any other terms that you think need to be footnoted  

If there are, add those in (terms plus footnote content)  

## Proofread, revise, and delete

Proofread and correct footnotes for any errors in spelling, punctuation, grammar  

Revise/rewrite any footnotes that are unclear or verbose  

Don't be afraid to revise, make changes, or delete words, as Github saves all versions of a file (i.e., we can always find deleted text in an earlier version of the file and put it back in if we need to)  

## Make sure to include the term you/your partner are defining in your footnote, if it’s not exactly the term that Grainger uses

For example, see this footnote that I wrote: "119.593 Sparta's. Sparta was a powerful city-state in ancient Greece."  

Since Grainger uses “Sparta’s,” I made sure to start the footnote with the word “Sparta.”  

## Standardize internal citations

By internal citations, I mean references to other footnotes we’ve written for other lines of Grainger  

For now, let’s go with this format: "See note for [internal] Book II, line 452."  

I say “for now” because this is something that might change (i.e., we might decide, after consulting with the whole team, that we need to re-format these internal citations again). But I think we should standardize our own for now, just to be consistent within our own group  

The [internal] is something that Alex requested we add to any location where we would end up inserting a clickable link to take the reader to that other line within Grainger  

## Double-check and standardize plant and animal names (and references to families)

Use https://www.itis.gov/ to double-check scientific names for plants and animals. This is a comprehensive database with accepted names for plants and animals.  

Examples of plant names: *Hura crepitans* L., *Passiflora tripartita* (Juss.) Poir. Note that sometimes, name abbreviations are in parentheses, and sometimes they are not. Also note that while the binomial is italicized, the name abbreviations for botanists are not. Also not that the genus is capitalized, and the species is not.  

Examples of animal names: *Scomberomorus cavalla* (Cuvier, 1829), *Leontopithecus caissara* Lorini and Persson, 1990. Note that sometimes, the namer and date are in parentheses, and sometimes, they are not. Also, unlike plant names, animal names include dates.  

If you cite the name of a family, it should be capitalized but not italicized. For example, see this footnote: "117.558 herald-lark. Any of several small birds of the family Alaudidae. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World."
