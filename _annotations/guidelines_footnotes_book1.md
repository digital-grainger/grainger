# Guidelines for footnoting Book I

## Economize

Remember again that we are writing for advanced undergraduates and educated readers. If a geographical or mythological term is in common usage (for example, Venus), don't footnote it. For example, "Venus" does not need to be footnoted.  

If two or more terms to be footnoted appear in close proximity to each other, and if it makes sense to footnote them as a group, consider doing so. For example, "94.131 Lincoln-plains...Lincoln...Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Dyer was the rector of the parishes of Coningsby and Kirkby in Lincolnshire, a county in eastern England, when he died." Or "103.306-307 Kent...Gaul. Kent is a county in southeastern England facing France, which was part of the ancient region of Gaul."  

## Define terms

Make sure to include the term you are defining in your footnote, if it’s not exactly the term that Grainger uses. For example, "119.593 Sparta's. Sparta was a powerful city-state in ancient Greece."  Since Grainger uses “Sparta’s,” the footnote begins with the word “Sparta," the term actually being defined.    

## Standardize cross-references

A cross-reference is a reference to another footnote we’ve written for other lines of Grainger  

For now, let’s go with this format: "See note for [internal] Book II, line 452."    

The [internal] is something that we are adding to any location where we would end up inserting a clickable link to take the reader to that other line within Grainger 

Do not cross-reference a term the second time it appears in the same book. Do cross-reference terms when they appear in different books. 

In general, the first time a term appears is when it should be defined. All subsequent references in other books will be cross-references. 

## Footnoting plants and animals

The most important thing for us to include in plant and animal footnotes is information about their uses and/or symbolic significance, especially for enslaved Africans and Amerindians. 

Consult sources like Judith Carney's *In the Shadow of Slavery* and B. W. Higman's *Jamaican Food* to get this kind of information. Also consult primary sources like Patrick Browne's *Civil and Natural History of Jamaica* (1756). (The 1789 ed. of Browne's work is searchable on Google Books.) Another good place to look: the John Carter Brown Library's [Archive of Early American Images](https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/jcb-online/image-collections/archive-early-american-images).  

Also important to include: information about the geographic origin of the plant or animal. This information can be difficult to pin down: search various plant and animal databases and Oxford reference works to try to get a sense of where the plant or animal is from. Err on the side of caution, though, and don't include this information if you cannot find it in multiple, reliable sources.  

Finally, we are including scientific names for plants and animals, but we have decided to include only the binomial (i.e., the two-part Latin name designating genus and species). 

The binomial should always be italicized. The genus should always be capitalized, and the species should not. For example, *Hura crepitans*.   

If you cite the name of a family, it should be capitalized but not italicized. For example, see this footnote: "117.558 herald-lark. Any of several small birds of the family Alaudidae. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World."  

## Footnoting Caribbean places

When footnoting a place in the Caribbean that Grainger mentions, see where it is in relation to St. Kitts (or St. Christopher, as Grainger calls it). If it is in the Lesser Antilles, as St. Kitts is, mention that fact. For example, "98.222 Antigua. One of the Leeward Islands, the northern and more westerly part of the Lesser Antilles [Leeward Islands defined fully here because it is the first footnote Book III had on the Leeward Islands. Does not need to be defined fully in every footnote]. St. Kitts is also one of the Leeward Islands and lies just to the west of Antigua [That St. Kitts is part of the Leeward Islands similarly only needs to be said once]. Antigua was colonized by the English in 1632 and now forms part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda."

Note that the entry for Antigua also includes information about its present-day political status (i.e., it's now part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda). Include that information as well. 

If there is no clear geographic connection between St. Kitts and the place mentioned, just go with a basic entry like the following: "99.226 Tobago. An island located northeast of Trinidad and southeast of Grenada. Now part of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago."  

Also, remember that sometimes, Grainger mentions places specifically because military and other events have happened there recently. For example, "102.282 Karukera's. In 1759, as part of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), British forces attacked and forced the surrender of the French colony of Guadeloupe" and "102.283 Matanina! boast of Albion's arms. The French colony of Martinique surrendered to British forces in February 1762." Grainger does tend to hint at these events in the poem's lines, so read carefully for allusion.  

## Bibliography

Please add any primary or secondary works you consult as you are writing footnotes to the Zotero folder "Bibliography." We will use this folder to create a public bibliography for the project. Please make sure to include complete and accurate bibliographic information.  

In general, you do not need to include bibliographic information in footnotes (again, just make sure to add the works you've consulted to the Bibliography folder in Zotero). 

If you quote from a source, however, include the bibliographic information for now (in general, you should avoid quoting from sources; try to use your own words when writing footnotes).   

## Tags

For footnotes that define plants, begin the footnote with the tag [plant]. For example, "[plant] 116.549 papaws. Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its exact origins are unknown, but it is most likely from Central or South America."  

For footnotes that define non-mythological people, begin the footnote with the tag [people].  

For footnotes that define non-mythological places, begin the footnote with the tag [place].  

We will use these tags to compile glossaries, which will be a part of the public website.
