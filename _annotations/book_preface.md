[place] v West-Indies. Historically, the West Indies is the region that includes the northern coast of South America, Central America, Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. We use the term Caribbean throughout this site to refer to the islands from Grenada through Cuba.  

v could not fail to enrich poetry. Grainger explains that because the Caribbean landscapes, flora, and fauna are so different from those of Europe, the region can give rise to new forms of poetry.

v Genius. Grainger uses "genius" in the sense of poetic inspiration.

v instructing the reader. the georgic is a didactic mode, meaning that its principal aim is to teach the reader about agriculture and cultivation.  

v every writer who wishes to be thought a good man. Despite the fact that sugar was a major eighteenth-century cash crop and that the implicit goal of this poem is to help planters profit from their investments, Grainger makes an appeal for the disinterested nobility of his poetic labor.  

[place] v St. Christophers. Grainger left England for St. Christophers in 1759. Known as the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1983, the island was called Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. We use "St. Kitts" throughout this site to refer to what used to be known as St. Christophers or Liamuiga. In 1493, Christopher Columbus claimed St. Kitts for Spain, and it was partitioned between the French and the English in the early seventeenth century. While the two countries exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was firmly under British control when Grainger arrived during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). St. Kitts began as a tobacco colony but turned to sugar production in the mid-eighteenth century.  

vi rural oeconomy. Agriculture, farming.

vi improvement. The idea of improvement has long legal and philosophical roots. For the legal context, in which it refers to the cultivation of crops that transforms wilderness into property, see John Locke's *Second Treatise on Government* (1689). Grainger uses it here in the sense of progress, a central concern of the Enlightenment.  

[people] vi Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

[people] vi Colonel Martyn of Antigua. Colonel Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. Published in at least a dozen editions before the end of the eighteenth century, the *Essay* contained Martin's recommendations for plantation management and covered topics ranging from the regulation and management of enslaved labor to the planting and harvesting of cane. The *Essay* is written in prose, but it served as an important source for Grainger.  

[people] vi Hesiod. Hesiod (c. 700 BCE) was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on the eastern slope of Mt. Helicon. He was a contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*.   

[people] vi Virgil. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.

[people] vi Philips. John Philips (1676-1709), English poet and author of the georgic poem *Cyder* (1708).

[people] vi Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet. Author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757).

vii West-India georgic. A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that the Caribbean would transform the face of poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and imagines a new form for it (West-India). It is worth considering what specifically about this poem makes it West Indian or Caribbean.  

vii indigenous remedies, as well as diseases. Refers in part to the knowledge of indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, but it also refers to the local knowledge that African and European transplants to the Caribbean developed as they learned about the new environment. In particular, Grainger uses the poem to display his knowledge of husbandry, medicine, and natural history. We have tried in our notes to identify the origins of the natural entities, and especially the plants, named by Grainger. While some of these plants do originate from the Caribbean and the Americas, others come from Africa, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. In many cases, these foreign plants were brought to the Caribbean purposefully, as individuals sought to transform their new homes by importing crops and commodities that could help them survive and profit.  

vii physician. Born in Scotland, Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions dating back at least to the mid-1750s, when he settled in London. The phrase that closes his preface has long fascinated critics because it suggests a certain ambivlanece about the aims and the form of the poem. Certainly, Grainger was aware that the inclusion of local knowledge and the proliferation of footnotes were unusual, and he anticipated criticism of his choices.  

[place] vii Basseterre. The capital of St. Kitts.
