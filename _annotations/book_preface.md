v could not fail to enrich poetry. Grainger explains that because the Caribbean landscape is so different from European landscapes, it can produce new forms of poetry. To the extent that he describes his goal in aesthetic terms (including "picturesque images"), note his reliance on economic language ("enrich poetry").

v Genius. Grainger uses "genius" in the sense of poetic inspiration as opposed to truth.

v instructing the reader. the georgic is a didactic mode, meaning that its principal aim is to teach the reader.

v St. Christophers. Grainger left England for St Christophers in 1759. Now known as St. Kitts, the island was called Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. Christopher Columbus claimed the island for Spain in 1493, and it was simultaneously settled and partitioned by the French and the English in the early seventeenth century. It began as a tobacco colony, but turned to sugar in the mid seventeenth century alongside most other Caribbean colonies. While England and France exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteeth centuries, it was under British control when Grainger arrived during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Part of the British Commonwealth, it gained independence in 1983 and is now known as the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

vi West-Indies. Historically, the West Indies refer to the region that includes the northern coast of South America, Central America, Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. We use the term Caribbean throughout this site to refer to the islands from Trinidad and Tobago through Cuba.

vi rural oeconomy.  Agriculture; farming.

vi improvement. The idea of improvement has long legal and philosophical roots. For the legal context in which it refers to the cultivation of crops that transforms wilderness into property, see John Locke's *Second Treatise on Government* (1689). Here Grainger uses it in the sense of progress, a central ethos of the Englightenment.    

vi Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

vi Colonel Martyn of Antigua. Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. Published in at least a dozen editions before the end of the eighteenth century, the *Essay* contains Martin's recommendations for plantation management, which included the regulation and management of enslaved labor, the planting and harvesting of cane, and methods for making plantations more efficient. The *Essay* is written in prose, but it served as an important source for Grainger.

vi plantership. Art of planting? 

vi didactic. Educational; instructional.

vi Hesiod. Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), who was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on Mt. Helicon (the sacred Mount). Contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*. 

vi Virgil. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.

vi Philips.  John Philips (1676-1709), English poet and author of the georgic poem *Cyder* (1708).

vi Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet. Author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757).

vii <!-- TRANSLATION OF LATIN VERSE -->

vii West-India georgic. A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that Caribbean landscapes will transform the faceof poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and claims a new form (West-India). As with general theories of migration in the eighteenth century, one might consider this a hybrid or *creole* form. It is further worth considering what specifically about this poem is West Indian (or Caribbean). 

vii indigenous remedies, as well as diseases. See how many plants aren't indigenous in what follows, though. May mean endemic or naturalized. See note on transplantation obsession.  

vii physician. Scottish born Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions going back to his residence in London during the mid 1750s. This phrase has long fascinated critics, as it suggests a certain ambivalence about the aims and form of the poem <!--needs work-->

vii Basseterre. The capital of St. Kitts.
