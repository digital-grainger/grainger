v could not fail to enrich poetry. Grainger explains that because the Caribbean landscapes, flora, and fauna are so different from those of Europe, the region can give rise to new forms of poetry.

v Genius. Grainger uses "genius" in the sense of poetic inspiration, as opposed to truth.

v instructing the reader. the georgic is a didactic mode, meaning that its principal aim is to teach the reader about agriculture and cultivation.

v every writer who wishes to be thought a good man. In light of the fact that sugar was a major eighteenth-century cash crop, and despite the fact that the implicit goal of this poem is to help planters profit from their investements, Grainger makes an appeal for the disinterested nobility of his poetic labor.

v St. Christophers. Grainger left England for St Christophers in 1759. Known as the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1983, the island was called Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. Christopher Columbus claimed the island for Spain in 1493, and it was partitioned between the French and the English in the early seventeenth century. While the two countries exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was firmly under British control when Grainger arrived during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). St Kitts began as a tobacco colon, but turned to sugar production in the mid-eighteenth century.

vi West-Indies. Historically, the West Indies is the region that includes the northern coast of South America, Central America, Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. We use the term Caribbean throughout this site to refer to the islands from Grenada through Cuba.

vi rural oeconomy.  Agriculture, farming.

vi improvement. The idea of improvement has long legal and philosophical roots. For the legal context in which it refers to the cultivation of crops that transforms wilderness into property, see John Locke's *Second Treatise on Government* (1689). Grainger uses it here in the sense of progress, a central ethos of the Englightenment.    

vi Pere Labat. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

vi Colonel Martyn of Antigua. Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. Published in at least a dozen editions before the end of the eighteenth century, the *Essay* contains Martin's recommendations for plantation management, including the regulation and management of enslaved labor, the planting and harvesting of cane, and methods for making plantations more efficient. The *Essay* is written in prose, but it served as an important source for Grainger.

vi Hesiod. Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), who was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses near Mt. Helicon (the sacred Mount). Contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*. 

vi Virgil. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.

vi Philips.  John Philips (1676-1709), English poet and author of the georgic poem *Cyder* (1708).

vi Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet. Author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757).

vii West-India georgic. A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that the Caribbean would transform the face of poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and imagines a new form for it (West-India). It is worth considering what specifically about this poem makes it West Indian or Caribbean. 

vii indigenous remedies, as well as diseases. May refer to indigenous knowledge as well as local (i.e. creole) medicines. Grainger uses the poem to display his knowledge of husbandry, medicine, and natural history. In what follows, note how many of the plants, illnesses, and medicines are indigenous to the Caribbean, and how many have been imported from elsewhere and naturalized. Together, these demonstrate the importance of local knowledge to the practice of medicine, and they show how interconnected eighteenth-century landscapes and economies were.

vii physician. Born in Scotland, Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions dating back at least to the mid 1750s, when he settled in London. The phrase that closes his preface has long fascinated critics because it suggests a certain ambivlanece about the aims and the form of the poem. Certainly, Grainger was aware that the inclusion of local knowledge and the proliferation of footnotes were unusual, and he anticipated criticism on this score.

vii Basseterre. The capital of St. Kitts.
