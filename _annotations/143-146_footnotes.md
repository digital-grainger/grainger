143.369. bewitch'd. A reference to obeah, a set of Afro-Caribbean medicinal and religious practices. Colonial descriptions of obeah vary from magic to superstition to folk medicine. (general outline drawn from *Atlantic Studies* vol. 12 no. 2 "Obeah: knowledge, power, and writing in the early Atlantic World"). Colonial writers describe enslaved persons using plants or herbs to heal sickness or bring the dead back to life as well as deploying charms to defend against bullets or death, among other uses. Most accounts register the rebellious nature of these practices, and Grainger's poem was published in the aftermath of a large, coordinated 1760 rebellion in Jamaica that involved approximately 1,500 enslaved persons in which obeah played a particularly important role. (see Vincent Brown's http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html) <!--how much would we like to include in a footnote if we are also writing an essay about obeah? Can definitely cite specific examples (Long, Sloane, Singleton, Moseley, etc.)-->
