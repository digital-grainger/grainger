125.6 Papaw. Papaya; <!--copy note-->  
125.9 Rio GrandÃª. Major estuary in modern day Guinea-Bissau.  
125.9 Sanaga. Likely the Senegal river, which empties into the Atlantic ocean at St. Louis on Senegal's northern border with Mauritania. <!--thought this was the Senegal river (as does Gilmore), but there is a modern Sanaga river just south of Douala in Cameroon; have not found it on an 18thC map -->  
125.11 brede. Braid.  

126.17 dread Genius.  
126.21 Caribbe's. The Caribbean's

126.24 Sylvan bard <!--check-->  
126.25 Melvil. Robert Melville (1723-1809), Scottish army officer and colonial governor. Like Grainger, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the British army and fighting in the War of Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), he faught in the Caribbean, becoming temporary governor of Guadeloupe after defeating the French, and being named governor of Grenada, the Grenadines, Tobago, Dominica, and St. Vincent in 1764.

126.31 myrtle <!--copy-->

127.44 Congo's wide-extended plains. Kingdom in southwest African north of Angola and near the modern Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  
127.45 long Zaire. Zaire or Congo river. The second longest river in Africa, it drains into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of the DRC.
127.51 mechanic art. Here Grainger recommends that enslaved persons from the Congo be assigned specific trades rather than be forced to work as field laborers.  
127.52 ductile. Malleable; flexible.

128.62 Golden Coast. One of the four major trading region defined by European nations on the coast of West Africa.  These included the Grain Coast (modern day Sierra Leone and Liberia), the Ivory Coast (modern Cote d'Ivoire), the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and the Slave Coast (modern Togo, Benin, and Nigeria). These modern designations are approximations of eighteenth-century geographical regions. Certainly, people were enslaved from a much of the West African coast ranging at least from Senegal to Angola. <!-- Although I wrote it, this note makes me uncomfortable for all kinds of reasons CS -->  
128.63 Papaws. Also Popo. West African in the region between Accra in modern day Ghana and Ouidah in Benin. <!--see Gilmore too-->
128.65 Volta. Volta river in Ghana, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Accra (in modern Ghana).  
128.65 Rey. Likely the Rey (or Rio del Rey) estuary in modern day Cameroon. It is not clear whether Grainger means a specific river within this system.  
128.71 oft by suicide. At every stage of the slave trade -- from kidnapping and embarkation in Africa to transportation across the Atlantic, sale, and forced labor in the Americas -- suicide was one of the greatest concerns expressed by enslavers from the seventeenth century through abolition in the nineteenth century.  
128.72 gang. The enslaved on any plantation -- especially field laborers.  
128.82 Cormantee. Name given to Fanti people from Kormantse in the modern nation of Ghana. By the mid eighteenth century, the name Cormantee was associated with warlike people who resisted enslavement and who often led rebellions in the colonies. <!--get sources right-->  
128.88 poinard. Dagger.  
128.91 clayey tubes. Pipes.  
128.94 rice, or yams, or lofty maize. Three major food crops in West Africa. While rice and yams were indigenous to the region, maize is a New World crop that was brought to Africa. <!--confirm; do we need scientific names here?-->  

130.99 Minnah. City in central modern Nigeria. <!--have not found Minna on historical 18thC maps yet--> OR; Elmina, a city on modern Ghana's Atlantic coast. It was the first European settlement in West Africa, and a major stop in the Atlantic slave trade.  
130.102 Moco-nation. People from the region between Bonny Island and Calabar on the southeast coast of modern Nigeria <!-- https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/794d7o and near bonny here: https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/41t1wo and here: https://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/s/r654yp-->

130.113 Quanza. Cuanzo river in modern Angola. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean south of Luanda (known in the eighteenth century as Loango or Loando). This line therefore refers to enslaved people from Angola, who were primarily victims of the Portuguese trade.  
130.114 prone to bloat <!--not sure about this one-->  
130.119 Ethiop. Generic term for African, rather a person from Ethiopia.  
130.121 Machaon. Greek physician and son of Asclepius (son of Apollo and god of medicine).  
130.123 vervain. Plant from the *Verbena* family, widely used in medicine from at least the time of the ancient Egyptians.  
130.123 sempre-vive. *Sempervivum* ("always living"). Plant widely used in medicine, described here by Grainger as a laxative <!--see Gilmore for these 2 notes-->.  
130.127 white eagle. Calomel, or mercuric chloride. Medicine widely used in the eighteenth century for its laxative and purgative effects, also described here by Grainger as a vermifuge.  
130.133 The novel gang. Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.  Here Grainger is describing a practice known as "seasoning".
130.136 acajou. Cashew tree (*Anacardium occidentale*) native to Brazil. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic and is said to have been used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles. See for example Maria Riddell, *Voyages to the Madeira, and Leeward Isles* (Edinburgh, 1792), 82-83.  

132.141 rheums. Mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold, but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illness.  
132.141 dysenteric. Having to do with dysentery, or diarrhea.  
132.142 hydrops. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema). <!--Gilmore has diabetes, which might make more sense in context-->  
132.144 Lybians. Here used as a generic term for Africans.  
132n Gum-Arabic. Edible sap from the Acacia tree used as a glue/binder in foods and medicines.  
132.150 swallow dirt. Physicians and enslavers were fascinated with geophagy, or dirt eating among enslaved Africans (also called pica). They variously thought it was the symptom of a physical or psychological ailment that would invariably lead to death.  
132.150 Chlorotic fair. Chlorosis (also called green sickness) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

133.151 poignant cates. Food. Here Grainger uses it in the sense of "delicacies".

133.163 conch. Family of marine molluscs best know for their large shells, which can be used as musical horns when properly blown.  
133.165 Nor, Negroe. This and the following 40 lines are the only in the poem where the narrator addresses the enslaved directly.  
133.169 dark tartarean caves. Having to do with Tartarus, the part of the Greek underworld reserved for the wicked. Here Grainger refers to the work of miners.
