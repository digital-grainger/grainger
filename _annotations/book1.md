[plant] 20.234 provender. Generic term for dried cattle feed (e.g., hay).

[plant] 20.237 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.   

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*) is native to tropical Africa. Although eaten in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, some believed that its taste was too watery and that it could cause stomach problems and even worms.  

[plant] 21.237n boiled or roasted. One of the reasons yams became so important to the diets of enslaved Africans has to do with the fact that they can be prepared in numerous ways. Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed during slavery. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved Africans also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava.  

[plant] 21.237n They are a native of South-America, the West-Indies, and of most parts of Guinea. By Guinea, Grainger refers to a region on the west coast of Africa that bordered the Gulf of Guinea and served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade (Guinea is now the name of a country on the western coast of Africa). There is one South American species of yam named *Dioscorea trifida* that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, but there are no species of yam that originated in the Caribbean islands themselves. More important than *Dioscorea trifida*, however, to the diets of enslaved Africans were the Old World species of yam in West Africa. These species would have included *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa. They also would have included *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century and then brought with slave traders to the Americas.

22.270 demesnes. Demesne, a word of Anglo-Norman origin, signifies one's possession, chiefly of land or real estate.

[plant] 26.337n cedar. Red cedar (*Cedrela odorata*) has a strong odor.  

27.342 black crabs. Grainger may be referring to *Gecarcinus ruricola*, a species of terrestrial crabs widespread throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas. *G. ruricola* is currently the most commonly exploited land crab for human consumption in the Caribbean. Richard Hartnoll, Mark Baine, Yolima Grandas, Jennifer James, and Helen Atkin, "Population Biology of the Black Land Crab, * Gecarcinus ruricola *, in the San Andres Archipelago, Western Caribbean," *Journal of Crustacean Biology* 26.3 (2006): 316-325.

27.341n guana, or rather Iguana. A family of lizards (order Squamata, suborder Sauria). More than 700 species are identified today in the family, found principally in the temperate and tropical Americas; they are the New World counterparts of the Agamidae of the Old World, and often have a crest of spines running from the neck to the tail. Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.  

27.341n *Lues Venerea*. The term *lues venerea* was applied during the seventeenth century across Europe for all sexually transmitted diseases, often described as a single ailment. Leonardo Botallo of Paris used the term early on in 1563, as did Jean Fernel in 1579, to name syphilis, or the "French pox," and it remained the popular name for syphilis in the eighteenth century. Until the mid-eighteenth century, European medical thought commonly held that the *lues venerea* originated from a single virus. It was not until the nineteenth century that different kinds of sexually transmitted diseases were distinguished with specific names.

27.342n *cholera morbus*. The term *cholera morbus* is used today for the disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was applied to both cholera and cholera-like diseases. An acute diarrheal disease, symptoms of cholera include vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal pain. It is contracted from contaminated food or drinking water and feces.

In Homer's *Iliad*, the god Hephaestus (Greek, Hephaistos; Latin, Vulcan) forged an elaborate shield for Achilles after his armor was stripped from Patroclus by Hector. Classical tradition sometimes held that Cyclopes (sing. Cyclops, pl. Cyclopes), a clan of one-eyed giants, were craftsmen who assisted Hephaestus in his forge.

31.425 the arrow's deadening power. Sagittarius, the southern zodiacal constellation depicted as a centaur aiming an arrow, popularly called "the Archer." Its name derives from *sagitta*, Latin for "arrow." Sagittarius also denotes the ninth sign of the zodiac in astrology, lasting from 22 November to 21 December. By "the arrow's deadening power," Grainger means the November cold.

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*).  

[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. Plantain (family Musaceae), closely related to the banana. Plantains formed an important a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The plantain and banana probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.

[plant] 35.499 limes, with lemons. Columbus brought limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*) to the Caribbean, and he probably also brought lemons (*Citrus limon*). 

[plant] 35.501 oranges. Could be the sour orange (*Citrus aurantium*) or sweet orange (*Citrus sinensis*). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the sour and sweet orange.  

[plant] 35.503 logwood-hedge. Logwood is the commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin.  

35.505 the flux. Flux broadly refers to an abundant flow from an organ or cavity. Diarrhea, for example, is otherwise known as the alvine flux; in the eighteenth century, the gastrointestinal disorder dysentery was often known as the "bloody flux" or "red flux." Risk factors for dysentery include poor sanitation, contaminated water supplies, close living quarters, and malnutrition. Dysentery remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

[plant] 35.508 ricinus. Grainger refers here to the physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 35.508n The plant from which the castor-oil is extracted is also called *Ricinus*. *Ricinus communis*, the castor oil plant.  

[people] 35.508n Ray. John Ray (1627-1705), English naturalist and botanist, author of *Historia plantarum* (*History of Plants*, 1686-1704), a three-volume encyclopedia of plants cataloging 18,600 species.

[plant] 35.508n The species of it which bears red coral-like flowers is named *Bellyach* by the Barbadians. The bellyache bush (*Jatropha gossypiifolia*) is native to the tropical Americas. 

35.508n melancholy. Prior to the eighteenth century, melancholy was understood within the framework of the humoral theory of the body articulated by Aristotle, Galen, and Hippocrates, as a disease caused by an excess of "black bile" and characterized by negative emotions such as fear or sadness without explicit cause. Use of the term had expanded by the time of Grainger's writing to speak more generally of physiological disturbance, listlessness, or dejection.

36.509. cholic. The contracting of hollow organs results in pain called colic.

[plant] 36.510 acassee. Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn.  

36.511. Jewry. Judaism.

[plant] 36.520 carnation. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, a shrub that produes showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that the women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved. The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.   

[people] 36.520n Depoinci. General Philippe de Lonvilliers, chevalier de Poincy (1584-1660), governor of the French Antilles from 1647 to 1660.

[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to European naturalists and others concerned with the Americas because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. 

[people] 37.526n. Edwards. <!--who is this?-->

[plant] 38.538 wild liquorice. *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.  

38.543. Vermeil. bright red color.

38.544. Christobelle. <!--not sure who this is-->

38.536n The former is sometimes eaten, but the other seldom. The fruits and pads of *Opuntia* cacti have constituted an important food source for human beings and animals.

[plant] 38.538n Jumbee Beeds. The plant *Abrus precatorius* is a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdmonial cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration if ingested.

[plant] 38.538n. pigeon-peas. *Cajanus cajan*. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of enslaved Africans because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade. 

38.538n. emetic...pectoral. Emetics produce vomiting. Pectoral drinks aid in digestion.

[plant] 38.538n black ebony. Ebony refers to various Asian and Africa trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.  

[plant] 39.551 myrtle. See note for [internal] Book 1, p. 3. 

[plant] 39.556 citron. *Citrus medica*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the citron. 39.560. Dryad. Wood-nymph.

40.572. yellow death. Most often transmitted by mosquitos, occurs mostly in tropical climates, characterized by jaundice, fever, nausea or vomiting, and aches.

40.580. Montano. Grainger continues the next few pages describing Montano, a fictional planter who he lauds for treating his slaves humanely. It should be noted that this behavior, though presented as virtuous, makes its argument on economic grounds.

[plant] 41.596 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them.  

[plant] 41.596 cassada. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava had advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads.  

[plant] 41.597 tanies. Either *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* or *Colocasia esculenta*. The name tanie or tannia technically refers to *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta* were often conflated, however. Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. In addition to being called tanie or tannia, *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* also went by the common name yautia and is native to Central and South America. *Colocasia esculenta*, also known as eddo, dasheen, or taro, is native to Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 C. E. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. 

[plant] 41.596n. a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour.   

[plant] 41.596n. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino. Pineda is Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñá (1607-1680), author of *Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile* (finished 1672).  

[plant] 41.596n. one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*. Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America.  

[plant] 41.597n. three species of tanies, the blue, the scratching, and that which is commonly roasted. There are many different varieties of *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta*. By the scratching kind, Grainger refers to the fact that the leaves of both *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* and *Colocasia esculenta* contain needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate that irritate the mouth and throat when eaten. 

[plant] 41.597n. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad. Because the leaves caused irritation to those who consumed them and had to be boiled for long periods to reduce the scratching effect, they were mainly consumed by enslaved Africans.  

[people] 42.509. Raleigh. Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618) was an English privateer and courtier who persuaded Elizabeth I to support a colony at Roanoke. He was the the author of *Discoverie of Guiana*.

[plant] 42.598 soursop. The soursop (*Annona muricata*) is the fruit of a tree native Mexico, Central America, and South America. 

[plant] 42.599 ginger. Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) is probably native to India and was brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 42.599 Ralegh's pungent plant. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*).  

[plant] 42.601 cotton-shrub. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World.  

[plant] 42.605 cacao-walk. A grove of cacao trees. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[plant] 42.598n custard, star, and sugar-apples. Custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree native to Mexico, Central America, and South America. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (the largest of the Caribbean island groups; includes Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Cayman Islands). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.  

[plant] 42.598n guava. Fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, probably native to Central and South America but naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.

[plant] 43.606 coffee. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.  

43.607. Danae...Theodosia. Danaë is the mother of Perseus and daughter of Acrisius and Eurydice. <!--Theodosia??-->

[plant] 43.605n the addtion of vanellas and other hot ingredients. The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Central America, and other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which are native to the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry to varying degrees. For example, those with choleric (hot and dry) temperaments were supposed to avoid eating any foods also classified as hot or dry. The other humoral temperaments are sanguine (hot and moist), phlegmatic (cold and moist), and melancholic (cold and dry).  

[plant] 43.605n olive. The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years. It is a symbol of the Mediterranean, as well as a symbol of wealth, abundance, power, and peace.   

[plant] 43.605n *Madre de Cacao*. *Gliricidia sepium*. Native to Central and South America, used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[plant] 43.605n cassada, or bananas. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava had advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Bananas belong to the family Musaceae and are closely related to plantains. They formed a part of the diets of enslaved Africans living on early Caribbean plantations. Wild species of banana and plantain originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. The banana and plantain probably were first brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century.  

[plant] 43.605n good pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[plant] 43.605n cucumber. The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) is native to South Asia, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the early eighteenth century. 

[plant] 43.605n There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the clour and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown today in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

[plant] 43.605n This word is Indian. "Cacao" derives from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."

43.606n. Persian. Now Iran, the Persian empire which, at its height, spanned from Egypt through southwestern Asia to India.

43.606n. Arabia Felix. The name Ptolemy gave to the south and southwest of Arabia because of its fertile landscape.

43.606n. Constantinople. Present-day Istanbul.

44.618 Celsus. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (14-37 CE), Roman medical writer and author of the encyclopedia entitled *Arte*, of which eight books, *De medicina*, deal with various medical topics from Greek medicine to first-century medical theory. Celsus here used to refer to a general doctor. 

[plant] 44.625 tamarind-vista. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*) produces a fruit with a sticky, acidic pulp that has been used as a food ingredient for thousands of years. It is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, but it had spread to the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.  

[plant] 44.606n tea. *Camellia sinensis* is the species from which commercially produced tea is derived. It is native to Southeast Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

[plant] 44.625n senna. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.  

45.629 Lion. Grainger uses Lion to refer to the zodiac sign Leo (23 July-22 August), elicited to describe the heat of these months.
