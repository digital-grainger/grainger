[plant] 3.1 Cane. *Saccharum officinarum*, a large tufted perennial grass probably native to Southeast Asia and first brought to the Americas by Columbus.  

3.2 Beneath what signs to plant. Planting by the signs, also known as agricultural astrology, is a food production method that advises planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops based on moon phases and the astrological calendar.  

3.3 How the hot nectar best to christallize. The basic process of making sugar in the eighteenth century involved crushing raw sugar cane stalks to extract their juice, boiling the juice with chemical agents that would remove impurities, and then boiling it several more times to reduce it to a heavy syrup. When the syrup was close to crystallizing into sugar, it was poured into barrels or moulds that allowed liquid to drain off and the solid sugar crystals to remain behind.    

[plant] 3.6 myrtle-indolence. Myrtle (*Myrtus communis*) is an aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love. Rather than a traditional invocation of the muse, *The Sugar-Cane* begins with a muse who has been wandering and in love. Indeed, Grainger married Daniel Matthew Burt, whom he met during his transatlantic voyage to St. Kitts and who was the daughter of one of the most prominent planter families of the island, in 1759. Their daughter Louisa was born before he began composing the poem.

[people] 3.8 Ascrean Poet. Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), who was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on the eastern slope of Mt. Helicon (the sacred Mount). Contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*.  

3.9 swain. A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. A key figure in georgic poetry.  

[people] 3.11 Maro. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.  

[people] 3.12 Dyer. John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet. Author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757).  

[people] 3.12 Pomona's Bard. John Philips (1676-1709), English poet and author of the georgic poem *Cyder* (1708). Pomona is the Roman goddess of fruit.

[people] 4.19 Aurelius. Gilmore identifies Aurelius as George Thomas (c. 1694-1774), who was born to a planter family on the island of Antigua. Descended on his mother's side from Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop, Thomas was a member of the Antiguan colonial assembly before being named Governor of Pennsylvania (1738-1747). He was Governor of the Leeward Islands from 1753 to 1766.

Arrian or Lucius Flavius Arrianus (86-160 CE) was the author of various short essays and histories, including *Bithyniaca*, *Parthica*, and what is known as *Affairs of Alexander*. 

[people] 4.22n Pompey. Pompey or Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106-48 BCE), member of the First Triumvirate. He defeated Mithridates, King of Pontus, and established military order in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire.

[place] 4.22n Persia. Now known as Iran. At its height, the Persian Empire extended from Egypt to southwestern Asia and India. It was the traditional antagonist of ancient Greece.  

5.26 joint. As sugar cane grows, it forms segments called joints. Grainger is thus referring here to the growth of sugar cane.  

[place] 5.22n Barbary-coast. Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that runs from modern Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean and includes parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.  

[place] 5.22n Azores...Madeiras...Canary...Cape-Verd Islands...throve exceedingly. The Azores, Madeiras, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde Islands are groups of islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. They often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.  
 
[place] 5.22n Greater or Lesser Antilles. "Antilles" refers to the islands of the Caribbean and is often used as a substitute for "West Indies." The Greater Antilles are the large islands on the northwest end of the archipelago (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico).  The Lesser Antilles (further split into the Windward and Leeward Islands) are the islands ranging from the Virgin Islands in the north to Grenada in the south. St. Kitts is one of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.

5.22n *4 l. per C.* wt. Four pounds per hundredweight. A hundredweight (equivalent to 112 lbs) was a standard measure for commerce. £4 had the purchasing power of approximately forty days of wages for a skilled tradesman (see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/).  

[place] 5.22n East-Indies. The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

[plant] 6.34 wild red cedar. Most likely *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. Now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

[plant] 6.34 locust. The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey but now spread widely over the world. It is the source of carob, which is used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.  

[place] 6.22n. Guiana. Aggregate name for the colonies located along the northern coast of South America between the mouth of the Orinoco River (in modern Venezuela) and the mouth of the Amazon (in Brazil). Also included parts of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Colonizers included Portugal, France, the Netherlands, England, and Spain.  

6.22n treaty of Breda. The treaty of Breda (1667) concluded the Anglo-Dutch War between England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark. The treaty formalized a major reorganization of colonial power, with the English taking control of New York, New Jersey, Antigua, and Montserrat; the Dutch gaining control of Surinam; and the French reclaiming Acadia in Atlantic Canada. Significantly for *The Sugar-Cane*, the treaty restored the French and British partition of St. Kitts.

[plant] 7.37 guaiac. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.   

7.37n. diaphoretic. Having the property of inducing or promoting perspiration.

7.37n worms. Grainger is referring to parasitic worms (helminths) that live in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. There are many such parasites, including tapeworms and roundworms. Worms were a major health concern in the eighteenth century, producing such physical effects as malnutrition and anemia, as well as cognitive problems.

[people] 7.37n Acosta. José de Acosta (1539-1600), Jesuit theologian, philosopher, and missionary who traveled to and spent several years in Peru and Mexico. Chiefly known for his *Historia natural y moral de las Indias* (1590), one of the earliest and most comprehensive surveys of the Americas.  

[plant] 8.44 shaddoc. A citrus fruit (*Citrus maxima*) also known as the pomelo or pummelo. Native to Southeast Asia and known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by an Englishman named Captain Shaddock.  

[plant] 8.44 forbidden fruit. Refers to species of *Citrus* (family Rutaceae) that are now virtually extinct. It is similar in taste to the orange and the shaddock, and it is closely related to the grapefruit (Kumamoto et al., Bowman et al., Higman 180).

[plant] 8.45 sabbaca. Avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. An important part of the diets of the enslaved who had access to it: they likely harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens (Higman 158-160).  

[people] 8.45n Ulloa. Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).  

[plant] 8.45n two species; the one bearing a green fruit...and the other a red...and grows chiefly in Mexico. There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.

During his stay in Jamaica, Sloane amassed an extensive collection of natural specimens, including plants, that later served as the basis for his natural history, *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). Sloane also succeeded Isaac Newton as president of the Royal Society in 1727. Upon his death, he bequeathed his extensive collections, which he had made considerable additions to after returning from Jamaica, to the British nation. These served as the founding collections of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum in London.

20.234 provender. Dried cattle feed (e.g., hay).  

[plant] 20.237 yams. One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved persons in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as crucially, yams formed a part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Although there is one South American species of yam (*Dioscorea trifida*) that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, more important species to the diets of the enslaved were *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa, and *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century (Higman 72-81).  

[plant] 20.237n water-melon, or gourd. Watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus*) is native to Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Sudan.   

[plant] 21.237n boiled or roasted. Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed by the enslaved. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved persons also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava (Higman 78-81).

22.270 demesnes. Domains. 

22.260n junks. A gathering of stems or stalks.  

23.278 improvement. The idea of improvement has long legal and philosophical roots. For the legal context, in which it refers to the cultivation of crops that transforms wilderness into property, see John Locke's *Second Treatise on Government* (1689). Grainger uses it here in the sense of progress, a central concern of the Englightenment.  

24.311 ken. Range of vision.  

[people] 24.313 Mantuan Bard. Virgil was born in the Italian provice of Mantua.

26.339 Harpies. Creatures in Greek mythology depicted as winged women or birds with women's faces.  

27.342 black crabs. Probably *Gecarcinus ruricola*, also known as the black land crab. One of several species of terrestrial or land crabs, the black land crab lives in damp and shaded forest areas inland and migrates in large numbers to the sea to breed. It is one of the most commonly exploited land crabs for human consumption in the Caribbean. Eighteenth-century observers were often fascinated by the mass migration of land crabs.  

27.341n guana, or rather Iguana. A family of crested lizards (order Squamata, suborder Sauria). More than seven hundred species have been identified; they are found principally in the temperate and tropical Americas. Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.

27.341n alligator. The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.  

27.342n *cholera morbus*. *Cholera morbus* is used in modern medicine to describe the water-borne disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*. In the eighteenth century, however, it described a variety of illnesses with symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal pain. 

[plant] 27.342n mahoe-berry. May be the berries from the blue mahoe (*Hibiscus elatus*), a tree whose native range is Cuba and Jamaica. Also naturalized to other parts of the Caribbean; now the national tree of Jamaica.

30.397 Iris. In Greco-Roman mythology, Iris was the daughter of the Titan Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra; she is sometimes cited as the wife of Zephyrus, the west wind. Her name in Greek means rainbow. The goddess Juno took her to serve as her handmaid.  

30.407 the shield was forg'd for Peleus' Son. Peleus' son is Achilles. In Book 18 of the *Iliad*, the god Hephaestus forges an elaborate shield for Achilles to replace the armor that was lost when Hector killed Patroclus.    

31.416 Procyon. Alpha Canis Minoris, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor.

31.417 yet the fiery Sun in Leo rides. Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-July and exits it in mid-August.  

[plant] 31.418 anana. The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*) originated in Central or South America. It was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean (Higman 188).  

31.425 the arrow's deadening power. Refers to Sagittarius, the southern zodiacal constellation depicted as a centaur aiming an arrow; popularly known as the Archer. By "the arrow's deadening power," Grainger means the November cold. Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-November and exits it in mid-December.  

[plant] 31.427 lemon, orange, and the lime. Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*) (Higman 175).  

[plant] 31.430 yellow plantanes. Plantains (family Musaceae) are closely related to the banana, and they both formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved (although plantains were more important than bananas). Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. They subsequently were introduced to the Caribbean by the Spanish (Higman 134).    

31.432 'Till Capricorn command. Capricorn is the tenth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-December and exits it in mid-January.  

31.433 moist Aquarius melt. Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-January and exits it in mid-February.  

[plant] 31.418n cherimoya. *Annona cherimola*, a fruit that originated in South America and is perhaps native to Ecuador.  

[plant] 31.418n wild pine-apple, or ananas bravo. *Bromelia pinguin*. Its native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas.  

32.453 moon must blunt her horns. The pointed ends of the crescent moon are sometimes referred to as its horns. Grainger thus means that six moons or months must pass.  

33.459 alien. Belonging to another person, place, or family; from elsewhere, foreign.  

33.472 stern Neptune. Roman god of the sea.  

34.483 from Aries to the Bull. Aries is the first sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-March and exits it in mid-April. The Bull refers to the zodiacal sign of Taurus, which is the second sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-April and exits it in mid-May.  

34.484 the Virgin his hot beams inflame. The Virgin names Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-August and exits it in mid-September.  

34.488 wondering daughters of the main. Sea nymphs. Chiefly used in poetry, "main" denotes the ocean.  

34.489 ere Libra weigh the year. Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-September and exits it in mid-October.  

34.495 Unfailing herbage to thy toiling herds. Cane stalks often provided cattle with feed.  

34.482n *Seasons* in the West-Indies. In the Caribbean, seasons are generally divided into wet and dry, versus the four seasons commonly known in temperate zones.    

[plant] 35.503 logwood-hedge. Logwood is the commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin, which produces blue, red, and purple colors.  

35.505 the flux...Endemial ail. The flux is a general term for gastrointestinal disorders like dysentery (also known as the "bloody flux"). Dysentery remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Endemial means endemic or habitually present in a certain country or area.  

35.500n Saracens. Among the later Greeks and Romans, a name for the nomadic peoples of the Syro-Arabian desert; also used as a synonym for Arab and Muslim peoples.  

[plant] 35.508 ricinus. Grainger refers here to the physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century. The castor oil plant is probably native to northeastern Africa.  

[people] 35.508n Ray. John Ray (1627-1705), English naturalist and botanist. Author of *Historia plantarum* (1686-1704), a three-volume encyclopedia of plants cataloging 18,600 species.

[plant] 35.508n The species of it which bears red coral-like flowers is named *Bellyach* by the Barbadians. The bellyache bush (*Jatropha gossypiifolia*) has a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas.  

35.508n melancholy. Prior to the eighteenth century, melancholy was understood within the framework of humoral theories of the body (articulated by Aristotle, Galen, and Hippocrates) as a disease caused by an excess of "black bile" and characterized by such emotions as fear or sadness without explicit cause. Use of the term had expanded by the time of Grainger's writing to speak more generally of physiological disturbance, listlessness, or dejection.  

36.509. cholic. Also colic or painful stomach contractions.

[plant] 36.510 acassee. Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn. 

36.511. Jewry, stiff-neck'd race. The book of Exodus contains a passage referring to Israelites as a "stiff-necked people" (32: 9). The passage refers to the refusal of those accompanying Moses out of Egypt to give up their worship of idols. Yet the passage also has been cited by those seeking to characterize the Jewish people as obstinate for refusing to accept Christianity. As such, it has anti-Semitic dimensions, in that it suggests that Judaism's followers are sinful and fundamentally flawed, as well as attached to an inferior religion.   
[plant] 36.515 privet. Refers to any of a number of shrubs belonging to the genus *Ligustrum*. Native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia; commonly used for hedging. Some species are invasive.  

[place] 36.517. Grampia's piny hills. The Grampian Mountains in Scotland.  

[people] 36.510n. Tournefort. Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656-1708), French physician and botanist, author of *Éléments de botanique* (1694).

[plant] 36.520 carnation. *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, a shrub that produes showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved (2.124-125). The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.   

[people] 36.520n Depoinci. General Philippe de Lonvilliers, chevalier de Poincy (1584-1660), governor of the French Antilles from 1647 to 1660.  

[plant] 36.520n senna kind. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.  

36.520n stomachic. Good for the stomach.  

36.520n carminative. Having the quality of expelling flatulence.  

36.520n emmenagogue. Having the power to induce menstrual flow.  

36.520n *Cauda pavonis*. Peacock's tail.  

36.520n *Flower Fence*. Another common name for *Caesalpinia pulcherrima* because it was frequently used as a flowering barrier fence.

[place] 36.520n Guinea. A region on the west coast of Africa that served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade. It included parts of modern Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon but is not to be confused with the modern nation of Guinea on the western coast of Africa.  

37.524 Juno's bird. Juno has been associated with geese (family Anatidae) and peacocks (three species in the pheasant family Phasianidae).  

37.526. humming bird. Birds of the family Trochilidae.  

37.529. bird of Jove. An eagle (family Accipitridae). 

[people] 37.534. Vitruvius. Vitruvius Pollio (1st century BCE), Roman architect.

[plant] 37.536 prickly pear. Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to European naturalists and others concerned with the Americas because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. 

[people] 37.526n. Edwards. George Edwards (1694-1773), English artist and ornithologist. Author of *A Natural History of Uncommon Birds* (1743-1751).  

[plant] 38.538 wild liquorice. *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration. *Abrus precatorius* is native to Africa, Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific region.  

38.543. Vermeil. Bright red color.

38.544. Christobelle. Gilmore suggests that Christobelle refers to Grainger's wife, Daniel Matthew Burt. This seems likely, especially if one reads "Christobelle" as "Belle of St. Christopher." Lines 544-547 refer to Grainger's long-standing wish that he might one day own his own plantation. See, for example, his 25 March 1765 letter to Bishop Thomas Percy (Nichols 288).  

38.536n The former is sometimes eaten, but the other seldom. The fruits and pads of *Opuntia* cacti have constituted an important food source for human beings and animals.  

38.536n fucus. A paint or cosmetic for beautifying the skin; a wash or coloring for the face.  

[plant] 38.536n It grows naturally in some parts of Spain. *Opuntia ficus-indica*, which is native to Mexico, was introduced to Spain by Christopher Columbus upon his return from his first voyage.  

38.536n. scymitar. A scimitar is a short, curved, single-edged sword associated primarily with Turkey or the Middle East.  

38.538n scandent. Climbing, ascending.  

[plant] 38.538n. pigeon-peas. *Cajanus cajan*. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of the enslaved because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.   

38.538n. emetic...pectoral. An emetic is a medicine that excites vomiting. Pectoral drinks aid in digestion.

[plant] 38.538n black ebony. Ebony refers to various Asian and African trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.  

39.559 contagious blast. Gilmore identifies the blast as the disease that also has been called the black blight. It results from an infestation by the West Indian cane fly (*Saccharosydne saccharivora*).  

39.560. Dryad. Wood or tree nymph in Greek mythology.  

39.564. recks. Heeds, cares, minds, considers.  

40.572. yellow death. Yellow fever, a disease transmitted by the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito, occurs mostly in tropical climates and is characterized by jaundice, fever, nausea or vomiting, and aches. This urban disease was extremely deadly to newcomers from Europe.

40.580. Montano. Grainger continues the next few pages describing Montano, a fictional planter whom he lauds for treating his slaves humanely. It should be noted that this behavior, though presented as virtuous, is justified on economic grounds.  

40.572n Creoles. In the eighteenth century, the term creole was used to refer to individuals born in the Americas, regardless of ancestry.  

[plant] 41.596 cassada. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era; subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava has advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads (Higman 61-69).  

[plant] 41.597 tanies. Tanies were roots commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. The tanie, tannia, or yautia is technically the species *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*, but it was often confused with taro or eddo (*Colocasia esculenta*), another common root crop cultivated by the enslaved. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* has a native range extending from Costa Rica to tropical South America. *Colocasia esculenta* originated in southeastern or southern Central Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 CE. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food (Higman 82-86).  

[plant] 41.596n. a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour (Higman 62).   

[people] 41.596n. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino (Higman 69). Pineda is Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñá (1607-1680), author of *Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile* (finished 1672).  

[plant] 41.596n. one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*. Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America (now the name of the capital of French Guiana).  

41.597n. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad. Tannia and taro leaves were primarily consumed by the enslaved because they contained needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate. These crystals irritated the mouth and throat when eaten, and the leaves had to be boiled for a long period of time to reduce what was known as the "scratching" effect (Higman 86-87).  

[people] 42.599. Raleigh's pungent plant. Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618), an English courtier during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, as well as an explorer and author who obtained a patent for and helped to organize the expeditions to Roanoke in 1585 and 1587. He set out for South America in 1595, exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela, and again in 1617 to search for the famed city of El Dorado. He was executed for treason in 1618. Raleigh is the author of *Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana* (1596) and is associated with the introduction of tobacco to England (his "pungent plant").  

[plant] 42.598 soursop. The soursop (*Annona muricata*) is a fruit of tropical American origin.  

[plant] 42.601 cotton-shrub. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World.  

[plant] 42.605 cacao-walk. A grove of cacao trees. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[plant] 42.598n custard, star, and sugar-apples. Custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree whose native range is Mexico to northeastern Venezuela. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (Higman 202). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.  

[place] 42.601n. Levant. Refers to the eastern part of the Mediterranean; includes modern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Egypt.    

[people] 42.601n. Martinus. According to Gilmore, Matthias Martinius (1572—1630), author of *Lexicon Philologicum* (1623).  

43.607. Danae...Theodosia, thine. Gilmore suggests that these names reference Grainger's wife, whose first name was Daniel ("Daniel" sounds like "Danae").  

[plant] 43.605n the addition of vanellas and other hot ingredients. The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Mexico and Belize, as well as other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which have a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry.  

[plant] 43.605n olive. The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years.    

[plant] 43.605n *Madre de Cacao*. *Gliricidia sepium*. Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

43.605n good pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[plant] 43.605n cucumber. The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) has a native range extending from Himalaya to north Thailand.  

43.605n There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown today in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

43.605n This word is Indian. "Cacao" is derived from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."  

[place] 43.606n Arabia Felix. The name Ptolemy gave to the south and southwest of Arabia because of its fertile landscape.

[place] 43.606n Constantinople. Present-day Istanbul.

43.606n eighty years. The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "eighty" should read "one hundred and fifty."  

44.611 well-fed. In Book IV, line 430, Grainger admits that planters did not always provide enslaved laborers with sufficient food for survival.  

44.616 glander-pest. Grainger is referring to the glanders, a contagious disease in horses.  

[people] 44.618 Celsus. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (14-37 CE), Roman medical writer and author of the encyclopedia entitled *Arte*, of which eight books, *De medicina*, deal with various medical topics from Greek medicine to first-century medical theory. Celsus is used here to refer more generally to a doctor.  

[plant] 44.625 tamarind-vista. The tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*) is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes. 

[plant] 44.606n tea. *Camellia sinensis* is the species from which commercially produced tea is derived. Its native range is Southeastern Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

45.629 Lion. Refers to Leo, the fifth sign of the Zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-July and exits it in mid-August. 

46.642 zumbadores. Means buzzer in Spanish. As Grainger explains in his note, he is referring to the Andean condor (*Vultur gryphus*).
