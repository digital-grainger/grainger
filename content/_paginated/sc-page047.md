- To crush all undergrowth; before the sun,  
- The planets thus withdraw their puny fires.  
- And tho' untutor'd, then, thy Canes will shoot:  
- Care meliorates their growth. The trenches fill  
- With their collateral mold; as in a town [660]  
- Which foes have long beleaguer'd, unawares  
- A strong detachment sallies from each gate,  
- And levels all the labours of the plain.  

- AND now thy Cane's first blades their verdure lose,  
- And hang their idle heads. Be these stript off; [665]  
- So shall fresh sportive airs their joints embrace,  
- And by their alliance give the sap to rise.  
- But, O beware, let no unskilful hand  
- The vivid foliage tear: Their channel'd spouts,  
- Well-pleas'd, the watery nutriment convey, [670]  
- With filial duty, to the thirsty stem;  
- And, spreading wide their reverential arms,  
- Defend their parent from solstitial skies.  

The END of BOOK I.
