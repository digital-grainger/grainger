- THIS tract secure, with hedges or of limes, [465]
- Or bushy citrons, or the shapely tree
- That glows at once with aromatic blooms,
- And golden fruit mature. To these be join'd,
- In comely neighbourhood, the cotton shrub;
- In this delicious clime the cotton bursts [470]
- On rocky soils.—The coffee also plant;
- White as the skin of Albion's lovely fair,
- Are the thick snowy fragrant blooms it boasts:
- Nor wilt thou, cocô,[^f150n1] thy rich pods refuse;[^f150n2]
- Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require,[^f150n3] [475]
- Ere the stone grind them to the food of health.[^f150n4]
- Of thee, perhaps, and of thy various sorts,
- And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd,[^f150n5]
- With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;
- In future times, the enraptur'd muse may sing: [480]
- If public favour crown her present lay.

- BUT let some antient, faithful slave erect
- His sheltered mansion near; and with his dog,
- His loaded gun, and cutlass, guard the whole:
- Else negro-fugitives,[^f150n6] who skulk 'mid rocks [485]

[^f150n1]: Another name for cacao. 

[^f150n2]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts. 

[^f150n3]: Cacao trees take several years to produce pods that can be harvested.  

[^f150n4]: Cacao seeds are ground up to produce chocolate, which was branded as early as the seventeenth century as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is possible that maroons living in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food, too (Hughes, *The American Physitian* 131). 

[^f150n5]: Madre de Cacao (*Gliricidia sepium*). Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[^f150n6]: Grainger refers here to enslaved persons who have run away from plantations.
