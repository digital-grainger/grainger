- SOME place decoys, nor will they not avail,
- Replete with roasted crabs, in every grove
- These fell marauders gnaw; and pay their slaves
- Some small reward for every captive foe. [80]

- WITH Misnian arsenic,[^f58n1] deleterious bane,

[^f58n1]: A chemical compound used as rat poison.

[^f58n2]: Although raw cassava is poisonous to human beings, rats apparently could eat it without being unduly affected since Grainger recommends mixing cassava with Misnian arsenic to poison them. In fact, rats are recognized as major cassava pests today. 

[^f58n3]: Unwitting, ignorant.

[^f58n4]: Choice foods, viands, or delicacies.
