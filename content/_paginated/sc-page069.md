- SAY, can the Muse, the pencil in her hand, [270]
- The all-wasting hurricane observant ride?[^f69n1]
- Can she, undazzled, view the lightning's glare,
- That fires the welkin?[^f69n2] Can she, unappall'd,
- When all the flood-gates of the sky are ope,
- The shoreless deluge stem? The Muse hath seen [275]
- The pillar'd flame, whose top hath reach'd the stars;
- Seen rocky, molten fragments, flung in air
- From AEtna's[^f69n3] vext abyss; seen burning streams
- Pour down its channel'd sides; tremendous scenes!——
- Yet not vext AEtna's pillar'd flames, that strike [280]
- The stars; nor molten mountains hurl'd on high;
- Nor ponderous rapid deluges, that burn
- Its deeply-channel'd sides: cause such dismay,
- Such desolation, Hurricane! as thou;
- When the Almighty gives thy rage to blow, [285]
- And all the battles of thy winds engage.

- SOON as the Virgin's charms ingross the Sun;
- And till his weaker flame the Scorpion feels;
- But, chief, while Libra weighs the unsteddy year:[^f69n4]
- Planter, with mighty props thy dome[^f69n5] support; [290]
- Each flaw repair; and well, with massy bars,

[^f69n1]: In a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, Grainger notes that he had almost finished writing *The Sugar-Cane* and that this set-piece on the hurricane was one of the last sections that needed to be completed: "You may remember I some time ago mentioned my being engaged in a work of some length and difficulty. Lately I completed it, at least for the present, though no less than a Georgic, and in four books too. It is called the 'Cane Piece,' and was composed mostly in my rides to the different parts of the island to visit my patients. I now send you the whole; only as I have seen no hurricane, and have not yet had time to arrange my remarks on a fire by night in a cane field, those parts in the second book are incomplete" (Nichols 278).

[^f69n2]: welkin. Sky, firmament.

[^f69n3]: Etna, Europe's highest active volcano, located in Sicily.

[^f69n4]: Grainger is using astrological signs to designate peak hurricane season. The Virgin names Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-August and exits it in mid-September. Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-September and exits it in mid-October. Scorpio is the eight sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-October and exits it in mid-November. 

[^f69n5]: House.
