- Some mountain-ground: or, if waste broken land
- To thee belong, that broken land divide.
- This let them cultivate, one day, each week;
- And there raise yams, and there cassada's root:
- From a good daemon's staff cassada sprang, [450]
- Tradition says, and Caribbees believe;
- Which into three the white-rob'd genius broke,
- And bade them plant, their hunger to repel.
- There let angola's bloomy bush[^f148n1] supply

> VER. 449. *cassada*\] To an antient Carribean, bemoaning the savage uncomfortable life of his countrymen, a deity clad in white apparel appeared, and told him, he would have come sooner to have taught him the ways of civil life, had he been addressed before.

> VER. 454. *angola*\] This is called *Pidgeon-pea*, and grows on a sturdy shrub, that will last for years. It is justly reckoned among the most wholesome legumens. The juice of the leaves, dropt into the eye, will remove incipient films. The botanic name is *Cytisus*.

> VER. 456. *bonavist*\] This is the Spanish name of a plant, which produces an excellent bean. It is a parasitical plant. There are five sorts of bonavist, the green, the white, the


[^f148n1]: Refers to the pigeon pea. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that has historically been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in provision grounds because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.   

[^f148n2]: A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) whose native range includes the Cape Verde Islands, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.

[^f148n3]: John Ogilby's *America: being the latest, and most accurate description of the New World* (1671). Ogilby (1600-1676) was a Scottish publisher and geographer.
