- Amid this waste of waters; wept thy rage?

- THEN trust not, planter, to the unsteddy gale; [225]

- Other two pillars raise; the wood the same, [230]
- Of equal size and height. The Calaba

- Of mariners, which winds its fatal way
- Through heart of British oak,[^f99n4] reluctant leaves [235]
- The closer calaba.â€”By transverse beams
- Secure the whole; and in the pillar'd frame,
- Sink, artist, the vast bridge-tree's[^f99n5] mortis'd form
