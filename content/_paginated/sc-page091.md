- Aid not, ye winds! with your destroying breath,
- The spreading vengeance.—They contemn my prayer. [65]

- ROUS'D by the deafning bells, the cries, the blaze;
- From every quarter, in tumultuous bands,
- The Negroes rush; and, 'mid the crackling flames,
- Plunge, daemon-like! All, all, urge every nerve:
- This way, tear up those Canes; dash the fire out, [70]
- Which sweeps, with serpent-error, o'er the ground.
- There, hew these down; their topmost branches burn:
- And here bid all thy watery engines play;
- For here the wind the burning deluge drives.

- IN vain.—More wide the blazing torrent rolls;[75]
- More loud it roars, more bright it fires the pole!
- And toward thy mansion, see, it bends its way.
- Haste! far, O far, your infant-throng remove:
- Quick from your stables drag your steeds and mules:
- With well-wet blankets guard your cypress-roofs; [80]
- And where thy dried Canes in large stacks are pil'd.—

- EFFORTS but serve to irritate the flames:
- Naught but thy ruin can their wrath appease.
- Ah, my Palaemon! what avail'd thy care,

> VER. 81. *And where thy dried Canes*\] The Cane-stalks which have been ground, are called *Magoss*; probably a corruption of the French word *Bagasse*,[^f91n1] which signifies the same thing. They make an excellent fewel.

[^f91n1]: Bagasse refers to the crushed sugarcane stalks that are the byproduct of milling cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel to boil cane syrup and as cattle feed.
