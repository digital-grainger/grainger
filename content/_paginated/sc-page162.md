- And must for ever; still indulgent share [675]
- Her fostering smile: and other isles be given,
- From vanquish'd foes.â€”And, see, another race!
- A golden aera dazzles my fond sight! 
- That other race, that long'd-for aera, hail!
- THE BRITISH GEORGE NOW REIGNS, THE PATRIOT KING![^f162n1] [680]
- BRITAIN SHALL EVER TRIUMPH O'ER THE MAIN.

The END of BOOK IV.


[^f162n1]: Perhaps a reference to Henry St. Bolingbroke's *The Idea of a Patriot King* (1749), a treatise written for Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707-1751), on monarchy. It describes in idealized terms the policies and virtuous conduct of a patriot king waiting in the wings. The patriot king's accession was supposed to end political conflicts.
