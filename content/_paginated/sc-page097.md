- In separate parcels, far, the infected fling:
- Of bad Cane-juice the least admixture[^f97n1] spoils
- The richest, soundest; thus, in pastoral walks,
- One tainted sheep contaminates the fold. [185]

- NOR yet to dung-heaps thou resign the canes,
- Which or the sun hath burnt, or rats have gnaw'd.
- These, to small junks reduc'd, and in huge casks
- Steept, where no cool winds blow; do thou ferment:â€”.
- Then, when from his entanglements inlarg'd [190]
- Th' evasive spirit mounts; by Vulcan's[^f97n2] aid,
- \(Nor Amphitryte[^f97n3] will her help deny,\)
- Do thou through all his winding ways pursue
- The runaway; till in thy sparkling bowl
- Confin'd, he dances; more a friend to life, [195]
- And joy, than that Nepenthe[^f97n4] fam'd of yore,
- Which Polydamna,[^f97n5] Thone's imperial queen,
- Taught Jove-born Helen[^f97n6] on the banks of Nile.

- AS on old ocean, when the wind blows high,
- The cautious mariner contracts his sail; [200]
- So here, when squaly bursts the speeding gale,
- If thou from ruin would'st thy points preserve,
- Less-bellying canvass[^f97n7] to the storm oppose.
