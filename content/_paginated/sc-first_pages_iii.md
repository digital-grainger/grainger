[^ftp2n1]: A passage from the Roman poet Manilius' *Astronomica*. One translation reads, "[A]nd to be the first to stir with these new strains the nodding leaf-capped woods of Helicon, as I bring novel offerings untold by any before me: this is my aim" (Goold 5). Helicon is a mountain sacred to the Muses and hence a site associated with poetic inspiration.
