vii  
"In a West-India georgic, the mention of many indigenous remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is, I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known. And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet."  

10, 60n:  
"The Indian name of St. Christopher is *Liamuiga*, or the Fertile Island."

17, 170n:  
"That part of the Cane which shoots up into the fructification, is called by planters its Arrow, having been probably used for that purpose by the Indians. Till the arrow drops, all additional jointing in the Cane is supposed to be stopped."

41, 596n:  
"Cassavi, cassava, is called *Jatropha* by botanists. Its meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous. There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. The colour of its root is white, like a parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the Indians prepare many wholesome dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and, being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob. Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The French name it *Manihot*, *Magnoc*, and *Manioc*, and the Spaniards *Mandiocha*. It is pretended that all creatures but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There is one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*."

42, 598n:  
"The true Indian name of this tree is *Suirsaak*. It grows in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds. Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an acid. It is one of the *Anonas*, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples. The leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the West-Indies. The botanical name is *Guanabanus*. The French call it *Petit Corosol*, or *Coeur de Boeuf*, to which the fruit bears a resemblance. The root, being reduced to a powder, and snuffed up the nose, produces the same effect as tobacco. Taken by the mouth, the Indians pretend it is a specific in the epilepsy."

42-43, 605n.:  
"It is also called *Cocao* and *Coc√¥*. It is a native of some of the provinces of South America, and a drink made from it was the common food of the Indians before the Spaniards came among them, who were some time in those countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed, that the Indian chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I much doubt whether the Europeans have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and other hot ingredients."

106, 350n:  
"It were impossible, in the short limits of a note, to enumerate the various uses of Sugar; and, indeed, as these are in general so well known, it is needless. A few properties of it, however, wherewith the learned are not commonly acquainted, I shall mention. In some places of the East-Indies, an excellent arrack is made from the Sugar-Cane: And, in South-America, Sugar is used as an antidote against one of the most sudden, as well as fatal poisons in the world. Taken by mouth, *pocula morte carent*, this poison is quite innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood of the body immediately to the heart, it forthwith bursts it. The fish and birds killed by these poisoned arrows \(in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert\) are perfectly wholesome to feed on. See Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. It is a vegetable preparation."

357n:  
"This, by the natives, is emphatically called the *Dumb Cane*; for a small quantity of its juice being rubbed on the brim of a drinking vessel, whoever drinks out of it, soon after will have his lips and tongue enormously swelled. A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time, recommends it both by the mouth and externally, in dropsical and other cases: But I cannot say, I have had any experience of its efficacy in these disorders. It grows wild in the mountains; and, by its use in Sugar-making, should seem to be somewhat of an alcalescent nature. It grows to four feet high, having, at the top, two green shining leaves, about nine inches long; and, between these, a small spire emerges."

156, 567n:  
"Or maise. This is commonly called *Guinea-corn*, to distinguish it from the great or Indian-corn, that grows in the southern parts of North-America. It soon shoots up to a great height, often twenty feet high, and will ratoon like the other; but its blades are not so nourishing to horses as those of the great corn, although its seeds are more so, and rather more agreeable to the taste. The Indians, Negroes, and poor white people, make many (not unsavoury) dishes with them. It is also called *Turkey wheat*. The turpentine tree will also grow in the sand, and is most useful upon a plantation."

## Headnotes  
These passages demonstrate the depth of indigenous botanical and bodily knowledge, with uses ranging from medicine to food and resistance to cataloging. In some cases, such as the "Arrow,"" Grainger's notes reveal that these applications are so crucial to recognizing and describing these plants that they determine colonial naming schema. Most importantly, this knowledge is so integral to life in St. Kitt's that although in the preface, Grainger attempts to shift the locus of botanical and medicinal authority to himself with his own medical trials, these continued references maintain explicit references to Carib (Kalinago) origins and ownership of such knowledge. In fact, Grainger notes several indigenous names for various islands, registering previous and rightful land ownership in contrast to the proliferation of the British empire.
Despite such recognition, the above selections (with the exception of that from the preface) are footnotes, primarily from Book I. While Carib (Kalinago) knowledge may be crucial to the success of Grainger's project of cataloguing plants and their various uses, he formally allocates indigenous authority to the periphery of the text. This structural shift, although working to overwrite native knowledge, provides an opportunity to trace these origins through careful reading.
As a result, Grainger's attempts to contain and limit the impact of Carib (Kalinago) practices highlight the need to read through the text, highlighting implicit as well as explicit references to indigenous persons. For instance: who are the "Indians" to whom he refers, and where can we locate them in the Caribbean? How does his use of the passive voice in descriptions of plants' medicinal and agricultural uses distort genealogies of authority?
