# Climate  

Grainger's treatment of the tropical climate in *The Sugar-Cane* highlights the Caribbean environment's recalcitrance to colonial mastery, whether in the form of tempests, routine animal invasions, or even the irrepressible fertility of the land. *The Sugar-Cane* decenters imperialist conceit and anthropocentrism strikingly when Grainger turns to the climate, as he deploys poetic technologies to create an experience of sensory immersion in the New World, allowing space for an ecological consciousness that attends to relations among the human and the nonhuman.  

Thus, focusing on the West Indian ecology opens up a way of reading the poem for an alternative narrative of ecological entanglement, embedded through Grainger's extensive passages on climate conditions, principally concentrated in the first and second books. "Let then Sagacity, with curious ken," the poet advises, "Remark the various signs of future rain" (I.311-312). Changes, or the regard for changes, in the weather oblige a heightened awareness of the nonhuman community, and even the land itself comes alive, "laughing" (I.354).  

The weather also provides a useful point of entry for thinking about the affects that are to be had in the sugar colonies. Portions of the poem dedicated to cane cultivation often mention desire and ambition for potential wealth on the part of the enterprising planter, but tropical storms that overturn the plantation provoke a wide spectrum of emotions. Indeed, uncontrollable weather conditions cause great anxiety for the planter, and in Book II Grainger devotes one hundred and ten lines (II.270-380)—almost a fifth of the entire book—to describing the effects of a West Indian hurricane, the power of which is "all-wasting" (II.271). Representation becomes a fraught matter at this point in the poem, as the poet seeks to represent the natural phenomenon by relying on an array of poetic devices for aural and visual efficacy. In reading about storms and hurricanes, it is worth thinking about the poet's anxieties as well as the planter's, by asking: how does Grainger manage the tension between the limits and the capacities of language to render overwhelming environmental circumstances?  

By way of an interesting comparison, we may remark that where Grainger foregrounds the vulnerability of not only the colonist but also his neighboring animal and vegetal communities before the West Indian climate, explicitly dwelling on such threats, another major eighteenth-century text on sugar cultivation, Colonel Samuel Martin's *An Essay on Plantership*, dispenses with any discussion of climate, however crucial it proves to be for the plantation's operations. Martin, to whom Grainger alludes in tribute as he begins Book III, expatiates on different types of soil to be found in the British sugar colonies and the best months in which to plant and harvest the cane, but even as he comments that there "is not ... a greater error in the whole practice of plantership, than to make sugar, or to plant canes at improper seasons of the year," Martin nonetheless stresses the agency of the planter and his management above all, glossing over the details of "the destruction \[caused\] by hurricanes" (Martin 18). How, then, might we take *The Sugar-Cane*'s resolute commitment to the material realities of its specific West Indian context?

- And with fell rage the stranger-guest assail, [335]
- Nor spare the sportive child; from their retreats
- Cockroaches crawl displeasingly abroad:
- These, without pity, let thy slaves destroy;
- \(Like Harpies,[^f26n1] they defile whate'er they touch:)
- While those, the smother of combustion quells. [340]
- The speckled lizard to its hole retreats,

> VER. 334. *sand-flies,*\] This insect the Spaniards call *Mosquitilla*, being much smaller than the Mosquito. Its bite is like a spark of fire, falling on the skin, which it raises into a small tumour accompanied with itching. But if the sand-fly causes a sharper and more sudden pain than the Mosquito, yet it is a more honourable enemy, for remaining upon the skin after the puncture, it may easily be killed. Its colour is grey and black, striped. Lemon-juice or first runnings cure its bite.

> VER. 337. *Cockroaches crawl*\] This is a large species of the chafer, or scaribaeus, and is a most disagreeable as well as destructive insect. There is scarce any thing which it will not devour, and wherever it has remained for any time, it leaves a nauseous smell behind it. Though better than an inch long, their thickness is no ways correspondent, so that they can insinuate themselves almost through any crevise, *&c*. into cabinets, drawers, *&c*. The smell of cedar is said to frighten them away, but this is a popular mistake, for I have often killed them in presses of that wood. There is a species of Cockroach, which, on account of a beating noise which it makes, especially in the night, is called the Drummer. Though larger, it is neither of so burnished a colour, nor so quick in its motions as the common sort, than which it is also less frequent, and not so pernicious; yet both will nibble peoples toe-ends, especially if not well washed, and have sometimes occasioned uneasy sores there. They are natives of a warm climate. The French call them *Ravets*.

> VER. 341. *the speckled lizard*\] This is meant of the ground-lizard, and not of the tree-lizard, which is of a fine green colour. There are many kinds of ground-lizards, which, as they are common in the hot parts of Europe, I shall not describe.

- And black crabs[^f27n1] travel from the mountain down;
- Thy ducks their feathers prune; thy doves return,
- In faithful flocks, and, on the neighbouring roof,
- Perch frequent; where, with pleas'd attention, they [345]
- Behold the deepening congregated clouds,
- With sadness, blot the azure vault of heaven.

- NOW, while the shower depends, and rattle loud
- Your doors and windows, haste ye housewives, place
- Your spouts and pails; ye Negroes, seek the shade, [350]
- Save those who open with the ready hoe
- The enriching water-course: for, see, the drops,

> All of them are perfectly innocent. The Caribbeans used to eat them; they are not inferiour to snakes as a medicated food. Snuff forced into their mouth soon convulses them. They change colour, and become torpid; but, in a few hours, recover. The guana, or rather Iguana,[^f27n2] is the largest sort of lizard. This, when irritated, will fly at one. It lives mostly upon fruit. It has a saw-like appearance, which ranges from its head all along its back, to its tail. The flesh of it is esteemed a great delicacy. The first writers on the *Lues Venerea*,[^f27n3] forbid its use, to those who labour under that disease. It is a very ugly animal. In some parts of South-America, the alligator[^f27n4] is called *Iguana*.

> VER. 342. *And black crabs*\] Black land-crabs are excellent eating; but as they sometimes will occasion a most violent *cholera morbus*,[^f27n5] (owing, say planters, to their feeding on the mahoe-berry[^f27n6]) they should never be dressed till they have fed for some weeks in a crab-house, after being caught by the Negroes. When they moult, they are most delicate; and then, it is believed, never poison. This however is certain, that at that time they have no gall, but, in its stead, the petrifaction called a Crabs-eye is found. As I have frequently observed their great claws (with which they severely bite the unwary) of very unequal sizes, it is probable, these regenerate when broke off by accident, or otherwise.

- Which fell with slight aspersion, now descend
- In streams continuous on the laughing land.
- The coyest Naiads[^f28n1] quit their rocky caves, [355]
- And, with delight, run brawling to the main;
- While those, who love still visible to glad
- The thirsty plains from never-ceasing urns,
- Assume more awful majesty, and pour,
- With force resistless, down the channel'd rocks. [360]
- The rocks, or split, or hurried from their base,
- With trees, are whirl'd impetuous to the sea:
- Fluctuates the forest; the torn mountains roar:
- The main itself recoils for many a league,
- While its green face is chang'd to sordid brown. [365]
- A grateful freshness every sense pervades;
- While beats the heart with unaccustom'd joy:
- Her stores fugacious Memory now recalls;
- And Fancy prunes her wings for loftiest flights.
- The mute creation share the enlivening hour; [370]
- Bounds the brisk kid, and wanton plays the lamb.
- The drooping plants revive; ten thousand blooms,
- Which, with their fragrant scents, perfume the air,
- Burst into being; while the Canes put on
- Glad Nature's liveliest robe, the vivid green. [375]

- Shuns night; or, full-orb'd, in Night's forehead glows:
- For, see! the mists, that late involv'd the hill,
- Disperse; the midday-sun looks red; strange burs
- Surround the stars, which vaster fill the eye.[^f71n1] [315]
- A horrid stench the pools, the main emits;
- Fearful the genius of the forest sighs;
- The mountains moan; deep groans the cavern'd cliff.
- A night of vapour, closing fast around,
- Snatches the golden noon.—Each wind appeas'd, [320]
- The North flies forth, and hurls the frighted air:
- Not all the brazen engineries of man,[^f71n2]
- At once exploded, the wild burst surpass.
- Yet thunder, yok'd with lightning and with rain,
- Water with fire, increase the infernal din: [325]
- Canes, shrubs, trees, huts, are whirl'd aloft in air.——
- The wind is spent; and "all the isle below
- "Is hush as death."[^f71n3]
- Soon issues forth the West, with sudden burst;
- And blasts more rapid, more resistless drives: [330]


> VER. 314. *strange burs*\] These are astral halos. Columbus soon made himself master of the signs that precede a hurricane in the West-Indies, by which means he saved his own squadron; while another large fleet, whose commander despised his prognostics, put to sea, and was wrecked.

- Rushes the headlong sky; the city rocks;
- The good man throws him on the trembling ground;
- And dies the murderer in his inmost soul.—
- Sullen the West withdraws his eager storms.——
- Will not the tempest now his furies chain? [335]
- As, no! as when in Indian forests, wild,
- Barbaric armies suddenly retire
- After some furious onset, and, behind
- Vast rocks and trees, their horrid forms conceal,
- Brooding on slaughter, not repuls'd; for soon [340]
- Their growing yell the affrighted welkin[^f72n1] rends,
- And bloodier carnage mows th' ensanguin'd plain:
- So the South, sallying from his iron caves
- With mightier force, renews the aerial war;
- Sleep, frighted, flies; and, see! yon lofty palm, [345]
- Fair nature's triumph, pride of Indian groves,
- Cleft by the sulphurous bolt! See yonder dome,
- Where grandeur with propriety combin'd,
- And Theodorus with devotion dwelt;[^f72n2]
- Involv'd in smouldering flames.—From every rock, [350]
- Dashes the turbid torrent; thro' each street
- A river foams, which sweeps, with untam'd might,
- Men, oxen, Cane-lands to the billowy main.—[^f72n3]

- Pauses the wind.—Anon the savage East
- Bids his wing'd tempests more relentless rave; [355]
- Now brighter, vaster corruscations flash;[^f73n1]
- Deepens the deluge; nearer thunders roll;
- Earth trembles; ocean reels; and, in her fangs,
- Grim Desolation tears the shrieking isle,
- Ere rosy Morn possess the ethereal plain, [360]
- To pour on darkness the full flood of day.— 

- NOR does the hurricane's all-wasting wrath
- Alone bring ruin on its founding wing:
- Even calms are dreadful, and the fiery South
- Oft reigns a tyrant in these fervid isles: [365]
- For, from its burning furnace, when it breathes,
- Europe and Asia's vegetable sons,
- Touch'd by its tainting vapour, shrivel'd, die.[^f73n2]
- The hardiest children of the rocks repine:
- And all the upland Tropic-plants hang down [370]
- Their drooping heads; shew arid, coil'd, adust.——
- The main itself seems parted into streams,
- Clear as a mirror; and, with deadly scents,
- Annoys the rower; who, heart-fainting, eyes
- The sails hang idly, noiseless, from the mast.[^f73n3] [375]
