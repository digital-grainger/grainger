# About



This project originated from a desire to create an openly accessible edition of Grainger's *The Sugar-Cane* suited for undergraduate teaching. <!--further aims: pedagogically, thematically, etc.-->

## Contact Us  

Please feel free to reach out to us at digitalgrainger@gmail.com. We welcome comments and responses on any part of the site. We would also be very interested in hearing from anyone who uses the edition in the classroom: Are there features that worked particularly well for lesson planning, teaching, and assignments? What could be improved or added to make the site more useful? Any ideas for future collaborations are welcome, too. 

## Site Design

The site was designed using <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/ed/" target="blank">Ed, a Jekyll theme</a> created by Alex Gil. The site was designed and created by Kimberly Takahata and Alex Gil. Ed was designed to facilitate the creation of easy-to-use and beautiful digital editions. It is also based on "minimal computing principles," which ask site designers to reduce the size and complexity of sites in order to increase accessibility for users. Although the world is increasingly going digital, access to digital resources remains uneven. As such, we strove to create a site that would work on a wide range of devices and not require the use or purchase of specialized hardware or software. We also have kept page designs simple so that they can be loaded with relative ease, regardless of the availability of high-speed internet. Such considerations were especially important for us to consider since we wanted to making our edition widely available to students and teachers. Given that our edition deals centrally with the history of the Caribbean, we also wanted to make sure that it would be accessible to users there.

## Acknowledgments  

Without the generosity and expertise of those involved in digital scholarship at Columbia University Libraries, we would not have been able to build this project. In particular, Alex Gil spent countless hours (and emails) advising and training all creators in the science and art of digital design.

We also want to acknowledge the work of creators of similar digital projects on the Caribbean that provided us with models and inspiration. These include the following:


Funding for this project was provided by both Columbia and Fordham Universities. We would particularly like to acknowledge the Fordham University <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/academics/office_of_research/" target="blank">Office of Research</a> for initiating a Fordham-Columbia University Research Fellows Program and awarding us one of the fellowships. The fellowship funds enabled us to hire graduate students, provide them with experience and training in digital humanities, and create the project in truly collaborative fashion. We also would like to thank members of the digital humanities community at Fordham and specifically Shawn Hill, Instructional Technologist, and Elizabeth Cornell, Director of IT Communications. Shawn provided crucial advice and support, and Elizabeth participated as a full team member throughout the entirety of the project. The <a href="https://collab.fordham.edu/collabs/dh/" target="blank">Digital Humanities Working Group</a> at Fordham also provided early feedback and enthusiastic encouragement of the project. 

Finally, we would like to thank Vanessa Lee, the artist who created the image that appears at the top of our homepage. The other images on the homepage come from the John Carter Brown Library's <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/jcb-online/image-collections/archive-early-american-images" target="blank">*Archive of Early American Images*</a>. The images that appear in the "Counter-Plantation" section of the site also come from the *Archive of Early American Images*. We would like to thank the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/" target="blank"> John Carter Brown Library</a> and its staff for making historical works of art available for use to the public.

**Lina Jiang** is currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of English at Fordham University. Her research interests include eighteenth-century British literature, natural history, and the colonial Atlantic world. She built a digital archive called "Oscar Wilde and Charles Ricketts” in 2016. She also holds her BA in English language and literature from Fudan University and MA in English literature from New York University. 

**Julie Chun Kim** is co-edior of *Digital Grainger* and Associate Professor of English at Fordham University. She has published essays on Afro-Caribbean medicine, indigenous land rights, natural history, and early Caribbean plantation economies in *Early American Studies*, *The Eighteenth Century: Theory and Interpretation*, *Caribbeana: The Journal of the Early Caribbean Society*, and other venues. She is currently completing a book manuscript entitled "Gardening at the Edge of Empire: Colonial Botany in the Revolutionary Caribbean."

**Kimberly Takahata** is a doctoral candidate in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Her dissertation, entitled “Skeletal Testimony: Bony Ecologies in the Early Atlantic,” analyzes descriptions of human bones as sites of resistance in colonial accounts in order to disrupt depictions of indigenous and enslaved commodification and displacement.
