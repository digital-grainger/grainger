>in their voyages to and from South-America, and the Islands; accordingly we are told, when the English first landed there, which was about the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century, they found in it an excellent breed of wild hogs, but no inhabitants. In the year 1627, Barbadoes, with most of the other Caribbee-islands, were granted by Charles I. to the Earl of Carlisle, that nobleman agreeing to pay the Earl of Marlborough, and his heirs, a perpetual annuity of 300 *l.per annum*, for his waving his claim to Barbadoes, which he had obtained, by patent, in the preceding reign. The adventurers to whom that nobleman parcelled out this island, at first cultivated tobacco; but, that not turning out to their advantage, they applied, with better success, to cotton, indigo, and ginger. At last, some cavaliers of good fortune transporting themselves thither, and introducing the Sugar-cane [*A. D.* 1647] probably from Brazil, in ten years time the island was peopled with upwards of 30,000 Whites, and twice that number of Negroes, and sent yearly very considerable quantities of sugar to the mother-country. At the Restoration, King Charles II. bought off the claim fo the Carlisle-family; and, in consideration of its then becoming a royal instead of a proprietary government, the plantes gave the Crown 4 1/2 *per cent.* on their sugars; which duty still continues, although the island is said to be less able to pay it now than it was a hundred years ago.

It is separated from that island by a channel not above one ile and an half over, and lies to windward. Its warm bath possesses all the medical properties of the hot well at Bristol, and its water, being properly bottled, keeps as well at sea, and is no less agreeable to the palate. It was for many years the capital of the Leeward Island government; and, at that period, contained both more Whites and Blacks than it does at present, often mustering 3000 men. The English first settled there *A. D.* 1628. Sixty-two years aftewards, the chief town was almost wholly destroyed by an earthquake; and, in 1706, the planters were well-ngh ruined by the French, who carried off their slaves contrary to capitulation. It must have been discovered in Columbus's second voyage, *A. D.* 1493.

>VER. 135. *And breezy Mountserrat,*\] This island, which lies 30 miles to the south-west of Antigua, is not less famous for its solfaterre (or volcano), and hot petrifying spring, than for the goodness of its sugars. Being almost circular in its
