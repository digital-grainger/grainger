[66]()

- First pallid, sickly, dry, and withered show; [210]
- Unseemly stains succeed; which, nearer viewed
- By microscopic arts, small eggs appear,
- Dire fraught with reptile-life; alas, too soon
- They burst their slimy jail, and crawl abroad,
- Bugs of uncommon shape; thrice hideous show! [215]
- Innumerous as the painted shells, that load
- The wave-worn margin of the Virgin-isles!
- Innumerous as the leaves the plumb-tree sheds,
- When, proud of her faecundity, she shows,
- Naked, her gold fruit to the God of noon. [220]
- Remorseless to its youth; what pity, say,
- Can the Cane's age expect? In vain, its pith
- With juice nectarious slows; to pungent sour,
- Foe to the bowels, soon its nectar turns:
- Vain every joint a gemmy embryo bears, [225]
- Alternate rang'd; from these no filial young
- Shall grateful spring, to bless the planter's eye.â€”
- With bugs confederate, in destructive league,
- The ants' republic joins; a villain crew,

> VER. 218. *the plumb-tree sheds*,\] This is the Jamaica plumb-tree. When covered with fruit, it has no leaves upon it. The fruit is wholesome. In like manner, the panspan is destitute of foliage when covered with flowers. The latter is a species of jessamine, and grows as large as an apple-tree.
