[143]()

- With double night brood o'er them; thou dost throw, [350]
- O'er far-divided nature's realms, a chain
- To bind in sweet society mankind.
- By thee white Albion, once a barbarous clime,
- Grew fam'd for arms, for wisdom, and for laws;
- By thee she holds the balance of the world, [355]
- Acknowledg'd now sole empress of the main.
- Coy though thou art, and mutable of love,
- There may'st thou ever fix thy wandering steps;
- While Eurus rules the wide atlantic foam! 
- By thee, thy favourite, great Columbus found [360]
- That world, where now thy praises I rehearse
- To the resounding main and palmy shore;
- And Lusitania's chiefs those realms explor'd,
- Whence negroes spring, the subject of my song.

- NOR pine the Blacks, alone, with real ills, [365]
- That baffle oft the wisest rules of art:
- They likewise feel imaginary woes;
- Woes no less deadly. Luckless he who owns
- The slave, who thinks himself bewitch'd; and whom,
- In wrath, a conjurer's snake-mark'd staff hath struck! [370]
