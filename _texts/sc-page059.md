[59]()

- Graze its polluted brinks, till rolling time
- Have fin'd the water, and destroyed the bane.
- 'Tis safer then to mingle nightshade's juice [95]
- With flour, and throw it liberal 'mong thy Canes:
- They touch not this; its deadly scent they fly,
- And sudden colonize some distant vale.

- SHALL the muse deign to sing of humble weeds,
- That check the progress of the imperial cane? [100]

- IN every soil, unnumber'd weeds will spring;
- Nor fewest in the best: (thus oft we find
- Enormous vices taint the noblest souls!)
- These let thy little gang, with skillful hand,
- Oft as they spread abroad, and oft they spread; [105]
- Careful pluck up, to swell thy growing heap
- Of rich manure. And yet some weeds arise,
- Of aspect mean, with wondrous virtues fraught:
- (And doth not oft uncommon merit dwell
- In men of vulgar looks, and trivial air?) [110]
- Such, planter, be not thou asham'd to save

> VER. 95. *'Tis safer then to mingle nightshade's juice*\] See the article *Solanum* in Newman's Chemistry published by Dr. Lewis. There is a species of East-India animal, called a *Mungoes*, which bears a natural antipathy to rats. Its introduction into the Sugar-Islands would, probably, effectuate the extirpation of this destructive vermin.
