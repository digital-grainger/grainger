- Charm'd with the murmur of the tinkling rill;
- Charm'd with the hummings of the neighbouring hives;)
- Welcome thy glad approach: but chief the Cane,
- Whose juice now longs to murmur down the spout,
- Hails thy lov'd coming; January, hail! [30]

- O M \*\*\*\! thou, whose polish'd mind contains
- Each science useful to thy native isle!
- Philosopher, without the hermit's spleen!
- Polite, yet learned; and, tho' solid, gay!
- Critic, whose head each beauty, fond admires; [35]
- Whose heart each error flings in friendly shade!
- Planter, whose youth sage cultivation taught
- Each secret lesson of her sylvan school:
- To thee the Muse a grateful tribute pays;
- She owes to thee the precepts of her song: [40]
- Nor wilt thou, sour, refuse; tho' other cares,
- The public welfare, claim thy busy hour;
- With her to roam \(thrice pleasing devious walk\)

The Spaniards call it *Palo de China*. The botanical name is *Smilax*.
