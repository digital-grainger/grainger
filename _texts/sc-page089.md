- Charm'd with the murmur of the tinkling rill;
- Charm'd with the hummings of the neighbouring hive;\)
- Welcome thy glad approach: but chief the Cane,
- Whose juice now longs to murmur down the spout,
- Hails thy lov'd coming; January, hail![^f89n1] [30]

- O M \*\*\*\![^f89n2] thou, whose polish'd mind contains
- Each science useful to thy native isle!
- Philosopher, without the hermit's spleen![^f89n3]
- Polite, yet learned; and, tho' solid, gay!
- Critic, whose head each beauty, fond, admires; [35]
- Whose heart each error flings in friendly shade!
- Planter, whose youth sage cultivation taught
- Each secret lesson of her sylvan school:[^f89n4]
- To thee the Muse a grateful tribute pays;
- She owes to thee the precepts of her song: [40]
- Nor wilt thou, sour, refuse; tho' other cares,
- The public welfare, claim thy busy hour;
- With her to roam \(thrice pleasing devious walk\)

> vitae.[^f89n5] It also grows in China, and many parts of the East-Indies,[^f89n6] where it is greatly recommended in the gout,[^f89n7] palsy,[^f89n8] sciatica,[^f89n9] obstructions,[^f89n10] and obstinate headachs: but it can surely not effect the removal of these terrible disorders; since, in China, the people eat the fresh root, boiled with their meat, as we do turnips; and the better sort, there, use a water distilled from it. The Spaniards call it *Palo de China*. The botanical name is *Smilax*.

[^f89n2]: Colonel Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750. Published in at least a dozen editions before the end of the eighteenth century, the *Essay* contained Martin's recommendations for plantation management and covered topics ranging from the regulation and management of enslaved labor to the planting and harvesting of cane. The *Essay* is written in prose, but it served as an important source for Grainger.  

[^f89n3]: Bad temper or a melancholy temperament.  

[^f89n4]: Informal education provided by experience in nature or the wilderness, rather than in the classroom.

[^f89n5]: The hard, dense wood of the guaiac tree (*Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean). Lignum vitae ("wood of life") was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. 

[^f89n6]: The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

[^f89n7]: Paralysis of the skeletal muscles. 

[^f89n8]: Metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals.  
 
[^f89n9]: Irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. Causes severe pain from the lower back to the legs.  

[^f89n10]: Blocks in any tubular organ or structure, such as an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain.
