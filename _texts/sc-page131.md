[131]()

- Yet many die; and few, for many a year,
- Just strength attain to labour for their lord.

- WOULD'ST thou secure thine Ethiop from those ails,
- Which change of climate, change of waters breed, [120]
- And food unusual? let Machaon[^f131n1] draw
- From each some blood, as age and sex require;
- And well with vervain, well with sempre-vive,[^f131n2]
- Unload their bowels.—These, in every hedge,
- Spontaneous grow.—Nor will it not conduce [125]
- To give what chemists, in mysterious phrase,
- Term the white eagle;[^f131n3] deadly foe to worms.
- But chief do thou, my friend, with hearty food,
- Yet easy of digestion, likest that
- Which they at home regal'd on; renovate [130]
- Their sea-worn appetites. Let gentle work,
- Or rather playful exercise, amuse
- The novel gang:[^f131n4] and far be angry words;
- Far ponderous chains; and far disheartning blows.—
- From fruits restrain their eagerness; yet if [135]
- The acajou,[^f131n5] haply, in thy garden bloom,
- With cherries, or of white or purple hue,

> VER. 137. *cherries,*\] The tree which produces this wholesome fruit is tall, shady, and of quick growth. Its Indian name is *Acajou*; hence corruptly called *Cashew* by 

[^f131n1]: In Greek mythology, a physician and the son of Asclepius, the god of healing. 

[^f131n2]: Vervain (*Verbena officinalis*) is an herbal shrub whose native range is the Old World and Australia. The dried plant is used to make tea. Sempre-vive refers to the genus *Sempervivum* ("always living"), a group of plants native to Europe and parts of Asia. Gilmore notes that Grainger may not have been referring to European vervain but to *Aloe vera*, a plant highly valued for its medicinal properties and native to the Arabian Peninsula.  

[^f131n3]: Calomel or mercuric chloride. Medicine widely used in the eighteenth century for its laxative and purgative effects, also described here by Grainger as a vermifuge or drug used to eliminate parasitic worms from the body.

[^f131n4]: Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.  

[^f131n5]: The cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*). Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic, and it was supposedly used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles (Riddell 82-83).
