- \'Tis known the yam will ne'er to bigness swell;
- And from each mould the vegetable tribes,
- However frugal, nutriment derive: [240]
- Yet may their sheltering vines, their dropping leaves,
- Their roots dividing the tenacious glebe,
- More than refund the sustenance they draw.

- WHETHER the fattening compost, in each hole,
- \'Tis best to throw; or, on the surface spread; [245]
- Is undetermin'd: Trials must decide.
- Unless kind rains and fostering dews descend,
- To melt the compost's fertilizing salts;
- A stinted plant, deceitful of thy hopes,
- Will from those beds slow spring where hot dung lies: [250]
- But, if 'tis scatter'd generously o'er all,
- The Cane will better bear the solar blaze;
- Less rain demand; and, by repeated crops,
- Thy land improv'd, its gratitude will show.

- ENOUGH of composts, Muse; of soils, enough: [255]
- When best to dig, and when inhume  the Cane;
- A task how arduous! next demands thy song.

> a wholesome root, either boiled or roasted.[^f21n1] They will sometimes weigh one and an half, or two pounds, but their commonest size is from six ounces to nine. They cannot be kept good above half a year. They are a native of South-America, the West-Indies, and of most parts of Guinea.

[^f21n1]: Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed by the enslaved. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved persons also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava (Higman 78-81).
