[67]()

- As the waves, countless, that plough up the deep, [230]
- (Where Eurus reigns vicegerent of the sky,
- Whom Rhea bore to the bright God of day)
- When furious Auster dire commotions stirs:
- These wind, by subtle sap, their secret way,
- Pernicious pioneers! while those invest, [235]
- More firmly daring, in the face of Heaven,
- And win, by regular approach, the Cane. 

- 'GAINST such ferocious, such unnumber'd bands,
- What arts, what arms shall sage experience use? 

- SOME bid the planter load the favouring gale, [240]
- With pitch, and sulphur's suffocating steam:â€”
- Useless the vapour o'er the Cane-grove flies,
- In curling volumes lost; such feeble arms,
- To man tho' fatal, not the blast subdue.
- Others again, and better their success, [245]
- Command their slaves each tainted blade to pick
- With care, and burn them in vindictive flames.

> VER. 231. *Eurus reigns*\] The East is the centre of the trade-wind in the West-Indies, which veers a few points to the North or South. What Homer says of the West-wind, in his islands of the blessed, may more aptly be applied to the trade-winds.
