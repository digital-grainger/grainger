- Their sylvan lore convey: O may I join 
- This choral band, and from their precepts learn [15]
- To deck my theme, which though to song unknown,
- Is most momentous to my Country’s weal![^f4n1]

- SO shall my numbers win the Public ear;
- And not displease Aurelius;[^f4n2] him to whom,
- Imperial George, the monarch of the main,[^f4n3] [20]
- Hath given to wield the scepter of those isles,
- Where first the Muse beheld the spiry Cane,
- Supreme of plants, rich subject of my song.


> VER. 22. *the spiry Cane,*\] The botanical name of the Cane is *Saccharum*. The Greeks and Romans seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful plant. Lucan and Pliny are the only Authors among the former who mention it; and, so far as I can find, Arrian is the only Greek.[^f4n4] The first of these Writers, in enumerating Pompey’s Eastern auxiliaries,[^f4n5] describes a nation who made use of the Cane-juice as a drink:      

>   *Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos.*

> The industrious Naturalist says, *Saccharum et Arabia fert, sed laudatius India*; and the Greek Historian, in his *&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#987;* of the Red-sea, tells us of a neighbouring nation who drank it also; his words are, *&#956;&#949;&#955;&#953; &#964;&#959; &#967;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#967;&#935;&#945;&#961;&#953;*. The Cane, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably cultivated there time immemorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of; they afterwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the etymology, for the Arabic word &#1505;&#1499;&#1512; is evidently derived from the Hebrew &#1513;&#1499;&#1512;, which signifies an *intoxicating liquor*. When the Indians began to make the Cane-juice into sugar, I cannot discover;[^f4n6] probably, it soon found its way into Europe in that form, first by the Red-sea, and afterwards through Persia, by the Black-sea and Caspian; but the plant itself was not known to Europe, till the Arabians introduced it into the southern parts of Spain, Sicily, and those provinces of France which bor-  


[^f4n1]: Well-being, happiness, prosperity.  

[^f4n2]: Gilmore identifies Aurelius as George Thomas (c. 1694-1774), who was born to a planter family on the island of Antigua. Descended on his mother's side from Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop, Thomas was a member of the Antiguan colonial assembly before being named Governor of Pennsylvania (1738-1747). He was Governor of the Leeward Islands from 1753 to 1766.

[^f4n3]: George III (1738-1820) was king of Britain from 1760 to 1820. The main is the ocean.  

[^f4n4]: Lucan or Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (39-65 CE) was the nephew of Seneca the younger and the author of *The Civil War*. Gaius Plinius Secondus or Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) was the author of *Historia Naturalis*. Arrian or Lucius Flavius Arrianus (86-160 CE) was the author of various short essays and histories, including *Bithyniaca*, *Parthica*, and what is known as *Affairs of Alexander*.

[^f4n5]: Pompey or Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106-48 BCE) was a member of the First Triumvirate. He defeated Mithridates, King of Pontus, and established military order in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire.

[^f4n6]: In this note, Grainger traces the movement of sugar cane from India, where it was first refined into crystallized sugar, to the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas.
