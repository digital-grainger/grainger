[120]()

- The large, black, female, moulting crab excel? [610]
- A richer flavour not wild Cambira's hills,
- Nor Scotia's rocks with heath and thyme o'erspread,
- GIve to their flocks; than, lone, Barbuda, you,
- Than you, Anguilla, to your sheep impart.
- Even Britain's vintage, here, improve'd, we quaff; [615]
- Even Lusitanian, even Hesperian wines.
- Those from the Rhine's imperial banks (poor Rhine!
- How have thy banks been died with brother-blood?
- Unnatural warfare!\) strength and flavour gain
- In this delicious clime. Besides, the Cane [620]
- Wafted to every quarter of the globe,
- Makes the vast produce of the world your own.

- OR rather, doth the love of nature charm;
- Its mighty love your chief attention claim?

> VER. 613. *Barbuda*,/] This is a low, and not large stock-island, blonging to the Codrington family. Part of this island, as also two plantations in Barbadoes, were left by Colonel Christopher Codrington, for building a college Barbardoes, and converting Negroes to the Christian religion.
> VER. 614. *Anguillla*,/] This island is about thirty miles long and ten broad. Though not mountainous, it is rocky, and abounds with strong passes; so that a few of its inhaibatns, who are indeed expert in the use of fire-arms, repulsed, wiht great slaughter, a considerable detachment of French, who made a descent thereon in the war preceding the last. Cotton and cattle are its chief commodities. Many of the inhabitants are rich; the captain-general of the Leeward-Islands nominates the governor and council. They have no assembly.
