[129]()

- Not prominent their belly; clean and strong
- Their thighs and legs, in just proportion rise.
- Such soon will brave the fervours of the clime;
- And free from ails, that kill thy negroe-train,
- A useful servitude will long support. [80]

- YET, if thine own, thy childrens life, be dear;
- Buy not a Cormantee, tho' healthy, young.
- Of breed too generous for the servile field;
- They, born to freedom in their native land,
- Chuse death before dishonourable bonds: [85]
- Or, fir'd with vengeance, at the midnight hour,
- Sudden they seize thine unsuspecting watch,
- And thine own poinard bury in thy breast.

- AT home, the men, in many a sylvan realm, 
- Their rank tobacco, charm of sauntering minds, [90]
- From clayey tubes inhale; or, vacant, beat
- For prey the forest; or, in war's dread ranks,
- Their country's foes affront: while, in the field,
- Their wives plant rice, or yams, or lofty maize,
- Fell hunger to repel. Be these thy choice: [95]
- They, hardy, with the labours of the Cane
