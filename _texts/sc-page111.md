- Where rolls the Ganges, can a nobler show.
- So misers in their coffers lock that gold;
- Which, if allowed at liberty to roam, [445]
- Would better them, and benefit mankind.

- With sudden fury swells; some grease immix'd,
- The foaming tumult sudden will compose,
- And force to union the divided grain. [450]
- So when two swarms in airy battle join,
- The winged heroes heap the bloody field;
- Until some dust, thrown upward in the sky,
- Quell the wild conflict, and sweet peace restore.

- FALSE Gallia's sons, that hoe the ocean-isles, [455]
- Mix with their Sugar, loads of worthless sand,
