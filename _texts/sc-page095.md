[95]()

- When health danc'd frolic in her youthful veins,
- And vacant gambols wing'd the laughing hours;
- The muse hath seen on Annan's pastoral hills,
- Of theft and slaughter erst the fell retreat,
- But now the shepherd's best-beloved walk: [155]
- Hath seen the shepherd, with his sylvan pipe,
- Lead on his flock o'er crags, thro' bogs, and streams,
- A tedious journey; yet not weary they,
- Drawn by the enchantment of his artless song.
- What cannot musick?——When brown Ceres asks [160]
- The reapers sickle; what like magic found,
- Puff'd from sonorous bellows by the squeeze
- Of tuneful artist, can the rage disarm
- Of the swart dog-star, and make harvest light?

- AND now thy mills dance eager in the gale; [165]
- Feed well their eagerness: but O beware;
- Nor trust, between the steel-cas'd cylinders,
- The hand incautious: off the member snapt
- Thou'lt ever rue; sad spectacle of woe!

> VER. 168. *off the member snapt*\] This accident will sometimes happen, especially in the night: and the unfortunate wretch must fall a victim to his imprudence or sleepiness, if a hatchet do not immediately strike off the entangled member; or the mill be not instantly put out of the wind.
