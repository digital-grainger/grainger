- SOME place decoys, nor will they not avail,
- Replete with roasted crabs, in every grove
- These fell marauders gnaw; and pay their slaves
- Some small reward for every captive foe. [80]
- So practice Gallia's sons; but Britons trust
- In other wiles; and surer their success.

- WITH Misnian arsenic,[^f58n1] deleterious bane,
- Pound up the ripe cassada's[^f58n2] well-rasp'd root,
- And form in pellets; these profusely spread [85]
- Round the Cane-groves, where sculk the vermin-breed:
- They, greedy, and unweeting[^f58n3] of the bait,
- Crowd to the inviting cates,[^f58n4] and swift devour
- Their palatable Death; for soon they seek
- The neighbouring spring; and drink, and swell, and die. [90]
- But dare not thou, if life deserve thy care,
- The infected rivulet taste; nor let thy herds

> neral, foul feeders, many of them greedily devouring the raw guts of fowls: They also feed on dead mules and horses; whose carcasses, therefore, should be buried deep, that the Negroes may not come at them. But the surest way is to burn them; otherwise they will be apt, privily, to kill those useful animals, in order to feast on them.

> VER. 76. *Nor thou their wayward*\] Pere Labat says that Cane-rats give those Negroes who eat them pulmonic disorders, but the good Jesuit was no physician. I have been told by those who have eat them, that they are very delicate food.

[^f58n1]: A chemical compound used as rat poison.

[^f58n2]: Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, is a plant that is poisonous to human beings in raw form: its roots contain cyanide. Rats apparently could eat it without being unduly affected, however, since Grainger recommends mixing cassava with Misnian arsenic to poison them. In fact, rats are recognized as major cassava pests today. In spite of their toxicity, cassava roots served as one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, and they were subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. The poison in the roots can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Cassava's advantages are significant enough that they offset its toxic nature: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling (Higman 61-69).

[^f58n3]: Unwitting, ignorant.

[^f58n4]: Choice foods, viands, or delicacies.
