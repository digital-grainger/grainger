	*Vos sequor, o Graiae gentis decus, inque vestris nunc*
	*Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis;*
	*Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem,*
	*Quod vos imitari aveo.——*

IN a West-India georgic, the mention of many indigenous remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is, I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided them.

And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet.

*Basseterre, Jan.* 1763.
