[133]()

- Oft chalk prefer to the most poignant cates:\)
- Such, dropsy bloats, and to sure death consigns;
- Unless restrain'd from this unwholesome food,
- By soothing words, by menaces, by blows:
- Nor yet will threats, or blows, or soothing words, [155]
- Perfect their cure; unless thou, Paean, deign'st
- By medicine's power their cravings to subdue.

- TO easy labour first inure thy slaves;
- Extremes are dangerous. With industrious search,
- Let them sit grassy provender collect [160]
- For thy keen stomach'd herds.——But when the earth
- Hath made her annual progress round the sun,
- What time the conch or bell resounds, they may
- All to the Cane-ground, with thy gang, repair.

- NOR, Negroe, at thy destiny repine, [165]
- Tho' doom'd to toil from dawn to setting sun.
- How far more pleasant is thy rural talk,
- Than theirs who sweat, sequestered from the day,
- In dark tartarean caves, sunk far beneath

> VER. 163. *the conch*\] Plantations that have no bells, assemble their Negroes by sounding a conch-shell.
