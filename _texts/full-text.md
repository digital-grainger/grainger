P R E F A C E.

SOON after my arrival in the West-Indies,[^fvn1] I conceived the design of writing a poem on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane. My inducements to this arduous undertaking were, not only the importance and novelty of the subject, but more especially this consideration; that, as the face of this country was wholly different from that of Europe, so whatever hand copied its appearances, however rude, could not fail to enrich poetry with many new and picturesque images.[^fvn2]

I CANNOT, indeed, say I have satisfied my own ideas in this particular: yet I must be permitted to recommend the precepts contained in this Poem. They are the children of Truth, not of Genius;[^fvn3] the result of Experience, not the productions of Fancy. Thus, though I may not be able to please, I shall stand some chance of instructing the Reader; which, as it is the nobler end of all poetry, so should it be the principal aim of every writer who wishes to be thought a good man.[^fvn4]

IT must, however, be observed, that, though the general precepts are suited to every climate, where the Cane will grow; yet, the more minute rules are chiefly drawn from the practice of St. Christopher.[^fvn5] Some selection was necessary; and I could adopt no

[^fvn1]: Historically, the West Indies is the region that includes the northern coast of South America, Central America, Mexico, Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. We use the term Caribbean throughout this site to refer to the islands from Grenada through Cuba.

[^fvn2]: Grainger explains that because the Caribbean landscapes, flora, and fauna are so different from those of Europe, the region can give rise to new forms of poetry.

[^fvn3]: Poetic inspiration.

[^fvn4]: One of the georgic's principal aims was to teach the reader about agriculture and cultivation. Despite the fact that another of Grainger's goals was to help planters maximize their profits from sugar, which they depended upon enslaved labor to grow, Grainger also makes an appeal for the disinterested nobility and goodness of his poetic work.

[^fvn5]: The island of St. Christopher was known as Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. Columbus claimed it on behalf of Spain in 1493, and it was partitioned between the French and the English in the early seventeenth century, at which time it was primarily a tobacco colony. While the two countries exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was firmly under British control when Grainger left England in 1759 during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Grainger uses "St. Christopher," "Liamuiga," and "St. Kitts" interchangeably in the poem, but we have chosen to use "St. Kitts" on this site. St. Kitts has been part of the nation of St. Kitts and Nevis (also known as the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis) since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1983.

modes of planting, with such propriety, as those I had seen practiced in that island, where it has been my good fortune chiefly to reside since I came to the West-Indies.

I HAVE often been astonished, that so little has been published on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane, while the press has groaned under folios on every other branch of rural oeconomy.[^fvin1] It were unjust to suppose planters were not solicitous for the improvement of their art, and injurious to assert they were incapable of obliging mankind with their improvements.[^fvin2] 

AND yet, except some scattered hints in Pere Labat, and other French travellers in America; an Essay, by Colonel Martyn of Antigua, is the only piece on plantership I have seen deserving a perusal. That gentleman's pamphlet is, indeed, an excellent performance; and to it I own myself indebted.[^fvin3] 

IT must be confessed, that terms of art look awkward in poetry; yet didactic[^fvin4] compositions cannot wholly dispense with them. Accordingly we find that Hesiod and Virgil, among the ancients, with Philips and Dyer, (not to mention some other poets now living in our own country); have been obliged to insert them in their poems.[^fvin5] Their example is a sufficient apology for me, for in their steps I shall always be proud to tread.

[^fvin1]: Agriculture, farming.

[^fvin2]: In the eighteenth century, improvement referred to the cultivation and development of lands for the purpose of making them more economically valuable. Increasingly, philosophers, government officials, and others also came to believe that there was a moral imperative for individuals to improve their land, since it could lead to increased crop and food production, which in turn would prevent famine and other social ills. Improvement was tied up with imperial agendas of dispossession as well, however: it was often argued that indigenous peoples did not improve their lands and therefore did not have an inherent legal right to ownership over them.

[^fvin3]: Grainger credits the authors who have influenced him the most on the subject of sugar cultivation. Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738) was a French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. He liberated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, he served as a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and authored the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722). Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776) was an Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750 and then in several more editions before the end of the eighteenth century. The *Essay* contains Martin's recommendations for plantation management and covers topics ranging from the planting and harvesting of cane to the regulation of enslaved labor.

[^fvin4]: Instructive.  

[^fvin5]: Grainger also lists prior authors of classical and eighteenth-century georgic poems who have influenced him. Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE) authored the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*, which was a major influence on all neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century. Hesiod (c. 700 BCE) was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on the eastern slope of Mt. Helicon. He was a contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*. John Philips (1676-1709) was an English poet and author of the georgic poem *Cyder* (1708). John Dyer (1699-1757) was a Welsh painter and poet and author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757).

*Vos sequor, ô Graiae gentis decus, inque vestris nunc*  
*Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis;*  
*Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem,*  
*Quod vos imitari aveo.——*[^fviin1]  

Yet, like them too, I have generally preferred the way of description, wherever that could be done without hurting the subject.

SUCH words as are not common in Europe, I have briefly explained: because an obscure poem affords both less pleasure and profit to the reader.—For the same reason, some notes have been added, which, it is presumed, will not be disagreeable to those who have never been in the West-Indies.

IN a West-India georgic,[^fviin2] the mention of many indigenous remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is, I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known.[^fviin3] And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet.[^fviin4]

*Basseterre, Jan. 1763.*[^fviin5]

[^fviin1]: A passage from the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius' *De rerum natura* or *The Nature of Things*. One translation reads, "You I follow, Glory of the Greeks, and place my feet/Within your very footsteps. Not because I would compete/With you, but for the sake of love, because I long to follow/And long to emulate you" (Stallings).

[^fviin2]: A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that the Caribbean would transform the face of poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and imagines a new form for it (West-India). It is worth considering what specifically about this poem makes it West Indian or Caribbean.

[^fviin3]: Grainger's mention of indigenous remedies refers in part to the botanical knowledge possessed by indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, but it also refers to the local knowledge that African and European transplants to the Caribbean developed as they learned about the new environment. In particular, Grainger uses the poem to display his knowledge of husbandry, medicine, and natural history. We have tried in our notes to identify the origins of the plants named by Grainger. While some of these plants do originate from the Caribbean and the Americas, others come from Africa, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. In many cases, these foreign plants were brought to the Caribbean purposefully, as individuals sought to transform their new homes by importing crops and commodities that could help them survive and profit.

[^fviin4]: Born in Scotland, Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions dating back at least to the mid-1750s, when he settled in London. The sentence that closes his preface has long fascinated critics because it suggests a certain ambivalence about the aims and the form of the poem. Certainly, Grainger was aware that the inclusion of local knowledge and the proliferation of footnotes were unusual, and he anticipated criticism of his choices.  

[^fviin5]: Basseterre is the capital of St. Kitts.

- WHAT soil the Cane affects; what care demands;
- Beneath what signs to plant;[^f3n1] what ills await;
- How the hot nectar best to christallize;
- And Afric’s sable progeny to treat:[^f3n2]
- A Muse, that long hath wander’d in the groves [5]
- Of myrtle-indolence, attempts to sing.[^f3n3]

- SPIRIT of Inspiration, that did'st lead 
- Th’ Ascrean Poet to the sacred Mount,[^f3n4]
- And taught’st him all the precepts of the swain;[^f3n5]
- Descend from Heaven, and guide my trembling steps [10] 
- To Fame’s eternal Dome, where Maro[^f3n6] reigns;
- Where pastoral Dyer, where Pomona’s Bard,

[^f3n1]: Planting by the signs, also known as agricultural astrology, is a cultivation method that advises planting and harvesting crops based on moon phases and the astrological calendar.

[^f3n2]: The first four lines of the poem summarize the topics Grainger addresses in the four books of the poem. Book I introduces the reader to sugar cane and its cultivation; Book II concerns potential problems planters face in cultivating cane; Book III discusses the process of turning sugar cane into the final product of crystallized sugar; and Book IV deals with the management, treatment, and discipline of enslaved laborers.

[^f3n3]: Myrtle \(*Myrtus communis*\) is an aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love. Rather than a traditional invocation of the muse, *The Sugar-Cane* begins with a muse who has been wandering and in love. Indeed, Grainger married Daniel Matthew Burt, whom he met during his transatlantic voyage to St. Kitts and who was the daughter of one of the most prominent planter families of the island, in 1759. Their daughter Louise was born before he began composing the poem.

[^f3n4]: The Ascrean poet is Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), who was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on the eastern slope of Mt. Helicon (the sacred Mount). Contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*.

[^f3n5]: A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. A key figure in georgic poetry.

[^f3n6]: Maro is Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.

[^f3n7]: Grainger is listing other eighteenth-century authors of georgic poems. Dyer is John Dyer (1699-1757), a Welsh painter and poet and author of *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Pomona's bard is John Philips (1676-1709), an English poet and author of the *Cyder* (1708). Pomona is the Roman goddess of fruit. Smart is Christopher Smart (1722-1771), an English poet and author of *The Hop-Garden* (1752). Sommerville is William Somerville (1675-1742), an English poet and author of *The Chace* (1735).

> VER. 22. *the spiry Cane,*\] The botanical name of the Cane is *Saccharum*. The Greeks and Romans seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful plant. Lucan and Pliny are the only Authors among the former who mention it; and, so far as I can find, Arrian is the only Greek.[^f4n4] The first of these Writers, in enumerating Pompey’s Eastern auxiliaries,[^f4n5] describes a nation who made use of the Cane-juice as a drink:      

>   *Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos.*

> The industrious Naturalist says, *Saccharum et Arabia fert, sed laudatius India*; and the Greek Historian, in his *&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#987;* of the Red-sea, tells us of a neighbouring nation who drank it also; his words are, *&#956;&#949;&#955;&#953; &#964;&#959; &#967;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#967;&#935;&#945;&#961;&#953;*. The Cane, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably cultivated there time immemorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of; they afterwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the etymology, for the Arabic word &#1505;&#1499;&#1512; is evidently derived from the Hebrew &#1513;&#1499;&#1512;, which signifies an *intoxicating liquor*. When the Indians began to make the Cane-juice into sugar, I cannot discover;[^f4n6] probably, it soon found its way into Europe in that form, first by the Red-sea, and afterwards through Persia, by the Black-sea and Caspian; but the plant itself was not known to Europe, till the Arabians introduced it into the southern parts of Spain, Sicily, and those provinces of France which bor-  

[^f4n1]: Well-being, happiness, prosperity.

[^f4n2]: According to Gilmore, Aurelius refers to George Thomas (c. 1694-1774), who was born to a planter family on the island of Antigua. Descended on his mother's side from Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop, Thomas was a member of the Antiguan colonial assembly before he became governor of Pennsylvania (1738-1747). He was governor of the Leeward Islands from 1753 to 1766. Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of Rome from 161 to 180 CE. He was known both for his military campaigns against the Germanic tribes and for his philosophical *Meditations*.  

[^f4n3]: George III (1738-1820) was king of Britain from 1760 to 1820. The main is the ocean.

[^f4n4]: Lucan or Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (39-65 CE) was the nephew of Seneca the younger and the author of *The Civil War*. Gaius Plinius Secondus or Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) was the author of *Historia Naturalis*. Arrian or Lucius Flavius Arrianus (86-160 CE) was the author of various short essays and histories, including *Bithyniaca*, *Parthica*, and what is known as *Affairs of Alexander*.

[^f4n5]: Pompey or Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106-48 BCE) was a member of the First Triumvirate. He defeated Mithridates, King of Pontus, and established military order in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire.

[^f4n6]: In this note, Grainger traces the movement of sugar cane from India to the Americas. Sugar cane (*Saccharum officinarum*) is most likely native to New Guinea, where it was first cultivated thousands of years ago and from where it began to be dispersed by human migrants around 8000 BCE. By the fourth to sixth centuries CE, sugar cane was being refined into crystallized sugar in India and Persia. From there, sugar cane and knowledge of sugar cultivation, processing, and refining traveled to the Mediterranean. The Spanish then transplanted sugar to the Americas and established plantations there (Columbus first brought sugar to the Caribbean in 1493).

> der on the Pyrenean mountains. It was also successfully cultivated in Egypt, and in many places on the Barbary-coast.[^f5n2] From the Mediterranean, the Spaniards and Portuguese transported the Cane to the Azores, the Madeiras, the Canary and the Cape-Verd islands, soon after they had been discovered in the fifteenth century: and, in most of these, particularly Madeira, it throve exceedingly.[^f5n3] Whether the Cane is a native of either the Great or Lesser Antilles[^f5n4] cannot now be determined, for their discoverers were so wholly employed in searching after imaginary gold-mines, that they took little or no notice of the natural productions. Indeed the wars, wherein they wantonly engaged themselves with the natives, was another hindrance to physical investigation. But whether the Cane was a production of the West-Indies or not, it is probable, the Spaniards and Portuguese did not begin to cultivate it either there or in South America (where it certainly was found), till some years after their discovery. It is also equally uncertain whether Sugar was first made in the Islands or on the Continent, and whether the Spaniards or Portuguese were the first planters in the new world: it is indeed most likely that the latter erected the first sugar-works in Brazil, as they are more lively and enterprizing than the Spaniards. However they had not long the start of the latter; for, in 1506, Ferdinand the Catholic[^f5n5] ordered the Cane to be carried from the Canaries to St. Domingo,[^f5n6] in which island one Pedro de Atenca soon after built an *Ingenio de açucar*, for so the Spaniards call a Sugar-work. But, though they began thus early to turn their thoughts to sugar, the Portuguese far outstripped them in that trade; for Lisbon soon supplied most of Europe with that commodity; and, notwithstanding the English then paid the Portuguese at the rate of 4 *l. per C.* wt.[^f5n7] for muscovado,[^f5n8] yet that price, great as it may now appear, was probably much less than what the Sugar from the East-Indies[^f5n9] had commonly been sold for. Indeed, so intent was the Crown of Portugal on extending their Brazil-trade, that that of the East-Indies began to be neglected, and soon after suffered a manifest decay. However, their sugar made them ample amends, in which trade they continued almost without a rival for upwards of a century. At last the Dutch, in 1623, drove the Portuguese out of all the northern part of Brazil; and, during the one and twenty years they kept that conquest, those industrious republicans learned the art of making sugar. This probably inspired the English with a desire

[^f5n1]: As sugar cane grows, it forms segments called joints. Grainger is thus referring here to the growth of sugar cane.

[^f5n2]: Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that runs from modern Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean and includes parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.

[^f5n3]: The Azores, Madeiras, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde Islands are groups of islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. They often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.

[^f5n4]: The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "lesser" (or "Lesser") should read "less" (or "Less"). The term Antilles refers to the islands of the Caribbean and is often used as a substitute for West Indies. The Greater Antilles are the large islands on the northwest end of the archipelago \(Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico\). The Lesser Antilles (further split into the Windward and Leeward Islands) are the islands ranging from the Virgin Islands in the north to Grenada in the south. St. Kitts is one of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.

[^f5n5]: King Ferdinand V of Castile and León and II of Aragon \(1452-1516\), husband of Queen Isabella of Castille and patron with Isabella of Columbus' 1492 voyage.

[^f5n6]: Hispaniola, the island that includes the modern nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

[^f5n7]: Four pounds per hundredweight. A hundredweight \(equivalent to 112 lbs\) was a standard measure for commerce. £4 had the purchasing power of approximately forty days of wages for a skilled tradesman \(see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/\).

[^f5n8]:  A dark brown, unrefined sugar that was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. Often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Europe and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.

[^f5n9]: Historical term for the whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.

> of coming in for a share of the sugar-trade; accordingly they, renouncing their chimerical search after gold mines in Florida and Guiana,[^f6n3] settled themselves soon after at the mouth of the river Surinam, where they cultivated the Cane with such success, that when the colony was ceded to the Dutch by the treaty of Breda,[^f6n4] it maintained not less than 40,000 Whites, half that number of slaves, and employed one year with another 15,000 ton of shipping. This cession was a severe blow to the English-trade, which it did not recover for several years, though many of the Surinam Planters carried their art and Negroes to the Leeward Islands[^f6n5] and Jamaica[^f6n6], which then began to be the object of political consideration in England.  

> Sugar is twice mentioned by Chaucer,[^f6n7] who flourished in the fourteenth century; and succeeding poets, down to the middle of the last, use the epithet *Sugar'd*, whenever they would express any thing uncommonly pleasing: since that time, the more elegant writers seldom admit of that adjective in a metaphorical sense; but herein perhaps they are affectedly squeamish. 

> VER. 29. *Muscovado,*\] The Cane-juice being brought to the consistence of syrup, and, by subsequent coction,[^f6n8] granulated, is then called *muscovado* (a Spanish word probably, though not to be found in Pineda[^f6n9]) vulgarly brown Sugar; the French term it *sucre brut*.

> VER. 34. *wild red Cedar*\] There are two species of Cedar commonly to be met with in the West-Indies, the white and red, which differ from the cedars cultivated in the Bermudas:[^f6n10] both are lofty, shady, and of quick growth. The white succeeds in any soil, and produces a flower which, infused like tea, is useful against fish poison.[^f6n11] The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain. The wood of both are highly useful for many mechanical purposes, and but too little planted.

> VER. 34. *Locust*\] This is also a lofty tree. It is of quick growth and handsome, and produces a not disagreeable fruit in a flat pod or legumen, about three inches long. It is a serviceable wood. In botanical books, I find three different names for the locust-tree; that meant here is the *Siliqua edulis*.

[^f6n1]: Although Grainger calls muscovado silvery grey, it was actually a dark brown sugar. Muscovado was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. It was often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Europe and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.

[^f6n2]: The wild red cedar is *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. It is now considered vulnerable to extinction due to unsustainable levels of harvesting. The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.

[^f6n3]: Aggregate name for the colonies located along the northern coast of South America between the mouth of the Orinoco River (in modern Venezuela) and the mouth of the Amazon (in Brazil). Also included parts of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Colonizers included Portugal, France, the Netherlands, England, and Spain.

[^f6n4]: The Treaty of Breda (1667) concluded the Anglo-Dutch War between England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark. The treaty formalized a major reorganization of colonial power, with the English taking control of New York, New Jersey, Antigua, and Montserrat; the Dutch gaining control of Surinam; and the French reclaiming Acadia in Atlantic Canada. Significantly for *The Sugar-Cane*, the treaty restored the French and British partition of St. Kitts.

[^f6n5]: Leeward is a nautical term meaning sheltered from the wind (i.e., downwind). The Leeward Islands include the British and US Virgin Islands, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barthélemy, Barbuda, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Dominica.

[^f6n6]: Jamaica became an English colony in 1655. It gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1962. 

[^f6n7]: Geoffrey Chaucer (1340-1400), author of *The Canterbury Tales*. Gilmore notes that Chaucer uses sugar twice in *The Canterbury Tales* and again in *Troilus and Criseyde*.

[^f6n8]: Boiling, cooking.

[^f6n9]: Pineda is Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñá (1607-1680), author of *Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile* (finished 1672).  

[^f6n10]: The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*) is native to Bermuda and was used by early colonists as building material and fuel. By the 1830s, the ship-building industry had denuded Bermuda of most of its indigenous cedars. It is still a critically endangered species.  

[^f6n11]: By fish poison, Grainger is probably referring to ciguatera, a disease long associated with the consumption of predatory fish in the Caribbean. Ciguatera is a toxin produced by a marine microalgae called *Gambierdiscus toxicus*, and, like mercury, it becomes more concentrated in fish as they rise in the food chain. Symptoms of ciguatera include nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years.

>VER. 36. *or vast ceiba save.*\] Canoes have been scooped out of this tree, capable of holding upwards of a hundred people; and many hundreds, as authors relate, have been at once sheltered by its shade. Its pods contain a very soft short cotton, like silk: hence the English call the tree the Silk-cotton-tree; and the Spaniards name its cotton *Lana de ceiba*. It has been wrought into stockings; but its commonest use is to stuff pillows and mattrasses. It might be made an article of commerce, as the tree grows without trouble, and is yearly covered with pods. An infusion of the leaves is a gentle diaphoretic,[^f7n3] and much recommended in the small-pox. The botanical name of the ceiba is *Bombax*; and the French call it *Fromager*. There are two species; the stem of the one being prickly, and that of the other smooth.

>VER. 37. *Yet spare the guava,*\] The Spaniards call this tree *guayava*. It bears a fruit as large, and of much the same shape as a golden pippen. This is of three species, the yellow, the amazon, and the white; the last is the most delicate, but the second sort the largest: All are equally wholesome, when stewed or made into jelly, or marmalade. When raw, they are supposed to generate worms.[^f7n4] Strangers do not always at first like their flavour, which is peculiarly strong. This, however, goes off by use, and they become exceedingly agreeable. Acosta says the Peruvian guavas surpass those of any other part of America.[^f7n5] The bark of the tree is an astringent, and tanns leather as well as that of oak. The French call the tree *Goyavier*.

> VER. 37. —*yet the guaiac spare;*\] The lignum-vitae, or pockwood-tree. The virtues of every part of this truly medical tree are too well known to be enumerated here. The hardness and incorruptibility of its timber make abundant amends for the great slowness of its growth, for of it are formed the best posts for houses against hurricanes, and it is no less usefully employed in building wind-mills and cattle-mills.

[^f7n1]: Cassia is probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka. Ceiba is the kapok or silk-cotton tree (*Ceiba pentandra*). The ceiba, whose native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas, can achieve a height of fifty meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds.

[^f7n2]: The guava is a fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, which is probably native to Central and South America but was naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Guaiac refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. It also was widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.

[^f7n3]: Having the property of inducing or promoting perspiration.

[^f7n4]: Grainger is referring to parasitic worms (helminths) that live in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. There are many such parasites, including tapeworms and roundworms. Worms were a major health concern in the eighteenth century, producing such physical effects as malnutrition and anemia, as well as cognitive problems.

[^f7n5]: Acosta is José de Acosta (1539-1600), a Jesuit theologian, philosopher, and missionary who traveled to and spent several years in Peru and Mexico. Chiefly known for his *Historia natural y moral de las Indias* (1590), one of the earliest and most comprehensive surveys of the Americas.

> VER. 44. *The golden shaddoc,*\] This is the largest and finest kind of orange. It is not a native of America, but was brought to the islands, from the East-Indies, by an Englishman, whose name it bears. It is of three kinds, the sweet, the sour, and the bitter; the juice of all of them is wholesome, and the rind medical. In flavour and wholesomeness, the sweet shaddoc excels the other two, and indeed every other kind of orange, except the forbidden fruit, which scarce yields to any known fruit in the four quarters of the world. 

> VER. 45. *sabbaca:*\] This is the Indian name of the avocato, avocado, avigato, or, as the English corruptly call it, alligator-pear. The Spaniards in South-America name it *aguacate*, and under that name it is described by Ulloa.[^f8n3] However, in Peru and Mexico, it is better known by the appellation of *palta* or *palto*. It is a sightly tree, of two species; the one bearing a green fruit, which is the most delicate, and the other a red, which is less esteemed, and grows chiefly in Mexico.[^f8n4] When ripe, the skin peels easily off, and discovers a butyraceous,[^f8n5] or rather a marrowy like substance, with greenish veins interspersed. Being eat with salt and pepper, or sugar and lime-juice, it is not only agreeable, but highly nourishing; hence Sir Hans Sloane[^f8n6] used to stile it Vegetable marrow. The fruit is of the size and shape of the pear named Lady's-thighs,[^f8n7] and contains a large stone, from whence the tree is propagated. These trees bear fruit but once a year. Few strangers care for it; but, by use, soon become fond of it. The juice of the kernel marks linen with a violet-colour. Its wood is soft, and consequently of little use. The French call it *Bois d'anise*,[^f8n8] and the tree *Avocat*: the botanical name is *Persea*.

[^f8n1]: The shaddock and forbidden fruit are two kinds of citrus. The shaddock (*Citrus maxima*) is also known as the pomelo or pummelo. It is native to Southeast Asia and was known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by an Englishman named Captain Shaddock. The forbidden fruit refers to species of citrus that are now virtually extinct. It is similar in taste to the orange and the shaddock, and it is closely related to the grapefruit (Higman 180).

[^f8n2]: Acajou refers to the cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*). Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. The fruit is caustic and was supposedly used by women in the eighteenth-century Caribbean as a chemical peel to remove freckles (Riddell 82-83; also see Grainger's note in Book IV, p. 132). Sabbaca refers to avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Avocado was an important part of the diets of the enslaved who had access to it: they harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens (Higman 158-160).

[^f8n3]: Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).

[^f8n4]: There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.

[^f8n5]: Of the nature of butter; buttery.

[^f8n6]: Hans Sloane (1660-1753) was an Irish physician, naturalist, and collector who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 with Christopher Monck, second duke of Albemarle and newly appointed governor of Jamaica. During his stay in Jamaica, Sloane amassed an extensive collection of natural specimens, including plants, that later served as the basis for his natural history, *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). Sloane also succeeded Isaac Newton as president of the Royal Society in 1727. Upon his death, he bequeathed his extensive collections, which he had made considerable additions to after returning from Jamaica, to the British nation. These served as the founding collections of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum in London.

[^f8n7]: This is a pear known today as the jargonelle pear (*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'). It is one of the oldest pears in cultivation.

[^f8n8]: Anise wood. The leaves of some varieties of avocado give off a scent of anise when crushed.

> lies in seventeenth degree N. L.[^f9n6] It was discovered by the great Christopher Columbus,[^f9n7] in his second voyage, 1493, who was so pleased with its appearance, that he honoured it with his Christian name. Though others pretend, that appellation was given it from an imaginary resemblance between a high mountain in its centre, now called Mount Misery, to the fabulous legend of the Devil's carrying St. Christopher on his shoulders.[^f9n8] But, be this as it will, the Spaniards soon after settled it, and lived in tolerable harmony with the natives for many years; and, as their fleets commonly called in there to and from America for provision and water, the settlers, no doubt, reaped some advantage from their situation. By Templeman's Survey,[^f9n9] it contains eighty square miles, and is about seventy miles in circumference. It is of an irregular oblong figure, and has a chain of mountains, that run South and North almost from the one end of it to the other, formerly covered with wood, but now the Cane-plantations reach almost to their summits, and extend all the way, down their easy declining sides, to the sea. From these mountains some rivers take their rise, which never dry up; and there are many others which, after rain, run into the sea, but which, at other times, are lost before they reach it. Hence, as this island consists of mountain-land and valley, it must always make a midling crop; for when the low grounds fail, the uplands supply that deficiency; and, when the mountain canes are lodged (or become watery from too much rain) those in the plains yield surprisingly. Nor are the plantations here only seasonable, their Sugar sells for more than the Sugar of any other of his Majesty's islands; as

[^f9n3]: Gilmore defines after-offspring as second-growth cane that sprouts from the stumps once first-growth stalks have been cut and harvested (also known as "ratoon cane").

[^f9n4]: Tempé is the name of a valley in Thessaly located between Mounts Olympus and Ossa; it also can be used as a general name for a beautiful valley or rural spot. In Greek mythology, Pan is god of flocks and herds and is usually represented with the horns, ears, and legs of a goat on the body of a man. Pan lived in Arcadia, an idealized, utopian place in mythology and literature.

[^f9n8]: Grainger may be referring to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means "Christ carrier," once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river. Mount Misery was the name used by Europeans for the main volcanic mountain on St. Kitts. It was renamed Mt. Liamuiga when St. Kitts and Nevis became independent.  

[^f9n9]: Grainger is referring to Thomas Templeman's *A New Survey of the Globe: Or, an Accurate Mensuration of all the...Countries...in the World* (1729).

> their produce cannot be refined to the best advantage, without a mixture of St. Kitts' muscovado. In the barren part of the island, which runs out towards Nevis, are several ponds, which in dry weather crystallize into good salt; and below Mount Misery is a small Solfaterre and collection of fresh water, where fugitive Negroes often take shelter, and escape their pursuers.[^f10n2] Not far below is a large plain which affords good pasture, water, and wood; and, if the approaches thereto were fortified, which might be done at a moderate expence, it would be rendered inaccessible. The English, repulsing the few natives and Spaniards, who opposed them, began to plant tobacco here *A.D.* 1623. Two years after, the French landed in St. Christopher on the same day that the English-settlers received a considerable reinforcement from their mother-country; and, the chiefs of both nations, being men of sound policy, entered into an agreement to divide the island between them: the French retaining both extremities, and the English possessing themselves of the middle parts of the island. Some time after both nations erected sugar-works, but there were more tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton-plantations, than Sugar ones, as these require a much greater fund to carry them on, than those other.[^f10n3] All the planters, however, lived easy in their circumstances; for, though the Spaniards, who could not bear to be spectators of their thriving condition, did repossess themselves of the island, yet they were soon obliged to retire, and the colony succeeded better than ever. One reason for this was, that it had been agreed between the two nations, that they should here remain neutral whatever wars their mother-countries might wage against each other in Europe. This was a wise regulation for an infant settlement; but, when King James abdicated the British throne,[^f10n4] the French suddenly rose, and drove out the unprepared English by force of arms. The French colonists of St. Christopher had soon reason, however, to repent their impolitic breach of faith; for the expelled planters, being assisted by their countrymen from the neighbouring isles, and supported by a formidable fleet, soon recovered, not only their lost plantations, but obliged the French totally to abandon the island. After the treaty of Ryswick,[^f10n5] indeed, some few of those among them, who had not obtained settlements in Martinico[^f10n6] and Hispaniola, returned to St. Christopher: but the war of partition soon after breaking out, they were finally expelled, and the whole island was ceded in Sovereignty to the crown of Great Britain, by the treaty of Utrecht.[^f10n7] Since that time, St. Christopher has gradually improved, and it is now at the height of perfection. The Indian name of St. Christopher is *Liamuiga*, or the Fertile Island.

[^f10n1]: City and province in central Sicily.

[^f10n2]: Grainger refers here to enslaved persons running away from plantations and taking advantage of the rough terrain near Mt. Liamuiga to evade re-capture. A solfaterre is a volcano.  

[^f10n3]: Tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton were major agricultural commodities in the eighteenth-century Caribbean. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*) is native to the Americas. Indigo (genus *Indigofera*) is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[^f10n4]: King James was King James II of England and Ireland and James VII of Scotland (1633–1701). Son of Charles I, James II became king of England after the death of his brother, Charles II. He was the last Roman Catholic king of England and abdicated in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. 

[^f10n5]: Also Treaty of Rijswijk, signed in 1697 and named after the Dutch city in which it was signed. The treaty ended the Nine Years' War (1689-1697), in which Louis XIV's France faced a grand coalition of England, the Holy Roman Empire, the Dutch, and Spain. The treaty confirmed the effective disappearance of Spain as a maritime and continental power.

[^f10n6]: Martinico. Spanish name for the island of Martinique, the northernmost of the Windward Islands. Now an overseas department of France.  

[^f10n7]: The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) was part of the general settlement ending the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714). The treaty confirmed Philip V as King of Spain but required him to abandon his claim to the French throne. Additional provisions included the Spanish forfeiture of Gibraltar and Minorca to the British and the French forfeiture of claims to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Rupert's Land in northern Canada. The French also had to give the formerly partitioned St. Kitts entirely to the British. The British received the Asiento as well, a monopoly contract to supply the Spanish Americas with enslaved Africans.

>The island of Jamaica was bestowed on Columbus, as some compensation for his discovery of the new world; accordingly his son James settled, and planted it, early [*A. D.* 1509] the following century. What improvements the Spaniards made therein is no where mentioned; but, had their industry been equal to their opportunities, their improvements should have been considerable; for they continued in the undisturbed possession of it till the year 1596, when Sir Anthony Shirley,[^f13n4] with a single man of war, took and plundered St. Jago de la Vega,[^f13n5] which then consisted of 2000 houses. In the year 1635, St. Jago de la Vega was a second time plundered by 500 English from the Leeward islands, tho' that capital, and the fort, (which they also took) were defended by four times their number of Spaniards. One and twenty years afterwards, the whole island was reduced by the forces sent thither by Oliver Cromwell,[^f13n6] and has ever since belonged to England. It is by far the largest island possessed by the English in the West Indies. Sir Thomas Modyford, a rich and eminent planter of Barbadoes, removed to Jamaica *A. D.* 1660, to the great advantage of that island, for he instructed the young English settlers to cultivate the Sugar-cane; for which, and other great improvements which he then made them acquainted with, King Charles,[^f13n7] three years afterwards, appointed him Governour thereof, in which honourable employment he continued till the year 1669.[^f13n8]

In 1655, he launched what was known as the Western Design with the intention of dislodging Spanish power in the Caribbean and establishing an English presence there. English forces first tried to conquer Hispaniola and failed, but they did succeed in expelling the Spanish from Jamaica in 1655. Cromwell died in 1658, and his remains were exhumed in 1661, at which time he was posthumously "executed."

In the year 1627, Barbadoes, with most of the other Caribbee-islands, were granted by Charles I. to the Earl of Carlisle,[^f15n3] that nobleman agreeing to pay to the Earl of Marlborough,[^f15n4] and his heirs, a perpetual annuity of 300 *l. per annum*,[^f15n5] for his waving his claim to Barbadoes, which he had obtained, by patent, in the preceding reign. The adventurers to whom that nobleman parcelled out this island, at first cultivated tobacco; but, that not turning out to their advantage, they applied, with better success, to cotton, indigo, and ginger.[^f15n6] At last, some cavaliers of good fortune transporting themselves thither, and introducing the Sugar-cane [*A. D.* 1647] probably from Brazil, in ten years time the island was peopled with upwards of 30,000 Whites, and twice that number of Negroes, and sent yearly very considerable quantities of sugar to the mother-country. At the Restoration, King Charles II. bought off the claim of the Carlisle-family; and, in consideration of its then becoming a royal instead of a proprietary government, the planters gave the Crown 4 1/2 *per cent.* on their sugars; which duty[^f15n7] still continues, although the island is said to be less able to pay it now than it was a hundred years ago. It is upwards of 20 miles long, and in some places almost 14 broad.

It is separated from that island by a channel not above one mile and an half over, and lies to windward. Its warm bath possesses all the medical properties of the hot well at Bristol,[^f15n8] and its water, being properly bottled, keeps as well at sea, and is no less agreeable to the palate. It was for many years the capital of the Leeward Island government; and, at that period, contained both more Whites and Blacks than it does at present, often mustering 3000 men. The English first settled there *A. D.* 1628. Sixty-two years aftewards, the chief town was almost wholly destroyed by an earthquake; and, in 1706, the planters were well-nigh ruined by the French, who carried off their slaves contrary to capitulation.

[^f20n5]: One of the most important food crops for enslaved persons in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams (genus *Discorea*) became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as crucially, yams formed a part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Although there is one South American species of yam (*Dioscorea trifida*) that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, more widely used species in the colonial period included *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa, and *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century (Higman 72-81).

They cannot be kept good above half a year. They are a native of South-America, the West-Indies, and of most parts of Guinea.[^f21n2]

[^f21n1]: Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed by the enslaved. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved persons also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava (Higman 78-81).

[^f21n2]: A region on the west coast of Africa that served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade. Although its precise borders are difficult to pinpoint, it ranged from Sierra Leone to Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. It should not be confused with the modern nation of Guinea. It is important to note that European names for African places and ethnicities were imprecise. Slave traders and planters often identified enslaved individuals by their ports of embarkation (for example, Minnah, Papaw, and Coromantin), even though Africans may have identified themselves by their villages or districts of origin instead.

Where too many junks are planted in one hole, the Canes may be numerous, but can neither become vigorous, nor yield such a quantity of rich liquor as they otherwise would.

[^f23n1]: In the eighteenth century, improvement referred to the cultivation and development of lands for the purpose of making them more economically valuable. Increasingly, philosophers, government officials, and others also came to believe that there was a moral imperative for individuals to improve their land, since it could lead to increased crop and food production, which in turn would prevent famine and other social ills. Improvement was tied up with imperial agendas of dispossession as well, however: it was often argued that indigenous peoples did not improve their lands and therefore did not have a right to continue using and living on them.

Ugly ulcers have often been occasioned by scratching those swellings, in persons of a bad habit of body. Though natives of the West-Indies, they are not less common in the coldest regions; for Mr. Maupertuis[^f25n4] takes notice how troublesome they were to him and his attendants on the snowy summit of certain mountains within the arctic circle. They, however, chiefly love shady, moist, and warm places. Accordingly they are commonest to be met with in the corners of rooms, towards evening, and before rain. They are so light, as not to be felt when they pitch on the skin; and, as soon as they have darted in their proboscis, fly off, so that the first intimation one has of being bit by them, is the itching tumour. Warm lime-juice is its remedy. The Mosquito makes a humming noise, especially in the night-time.

Its bite is like a spark of fire, falling on the skin, which it raises into a small tumour accompanied with itching. But if the sand-fly causes a sharper and more sudden pain than the Mosquito, yet it is a more honourable enemy, for remaining upon the skin after the puncture, it may easily be killed. Its colour is grey and black, striped. Lemon-juice or first runnings cure its bite.

Though better than an inch long, their thickness is no ways correspondent, so that they can insinuate themselves almost through any crevise, *&c*. into cabinets, drawers, *&c*. The smell of cedar is said to frighten them away, but this is a popular mistake, for I have often killed them in presses of that wood. There is a species of Cockroach, which, on account of a beating noise which it makes, especially in the night, is called the Drummer. Though larger, it is neither of so burnished a colour, nor so quick in its motions as the common sort, than which it is also less frequent, and not so pernicious; yet both will nibble peoples toe-ends, especially if not well washed, and have sometimes occasioned uneasy sores there.

>All of them are perfectly innocent. The Caribbeans used to eat them; they are not inferiour to snakes as a medicated food. Snuff forced into their mouth soon convulses them. They change colour, and become torpid; but, in a few hours, recover. The guana, or rather Iguana,[^f27n2] is the largest sort of lizard. This, when irritated, will fly at one. It lives mostly upon fruit. It has a saw-like appearance, which ranges from its head all along its back, to its tail. The flesh of it is esteemed a great delicacy. The first writers on the *Lues Venerea*,[^f27n3] forbid its use, to those who labour under that disease. It is a very ugly animal. In some parts of South-America, the alligator[^f27n4] is called *Iguana*.

>VER. 342. *And black crabs*\] Black land-crabs are excellent eating; but as they sometimes will occasion a most violent *cholera morbus*,[^f27n5] (owing, say planters, to their feeding on the mahoe-berry[^f27n6]) they should never be dressed till they have fed for some weeks in a crab-house, after being caught by the Negroes. When they moult, they are most delicate; and then, it is believed, never poison. This however is certain, that at that time they have no gall, but, in its stead, the petrifaction called a Crabs-eye is found. As I have frequently observed their great claws (with which they severely bite the unwary) of very unequal sizes, it is probable, these regenerate when broke off by accident, or otherwise.

[^f27n1]: Probably *Gecarcinus ruricola*, also known as the black land crab. One of several species of terrestrial or land crabs, the black land crab lives in damp and shaded forest areas inland and migrates in large numbers to the sea to breed. It is one of the most commonly exploited land crabs for human consumption in the Caribbean. Eighteenth-century observers were often fascinated by the mass migration of land crabs.  

[^f27n2]: A family of crested lizards (order Squamata, suborder Sauria). More than seven hundred species have been identified; they are found principally in the temperate and tropical Americas. Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.  

[^f27n3]: *Lues venerea* was the medical term used for syphilis (also commonly known by the British as the "French pox").  

[^f27n4]: The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.  

[^f27n5]: *Cholera morbus* is used in modern medicine to describe the water-borne disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*. In the eighteenth century, however, it described a variety of illnesses with symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal pain. 

[^f27n6]: May be the berries from the blue mahoe (*Hibiscus elatus*), a tree whose native range is Cuba and Jamaica. Also naturalized to other parts of the Caribbean; now the national tree of Jamaica.

Its stem shoots up to a considerable height, but it does not divide into branches, till near the summit, where it shoots out horizontally, like an umbrella, into leaves, which resemble those of the common fern. I know of no medical uses, whereto this singularly beautiful tree has been applied, and indeed its wood, being spungy, is seldom used to oeconomical purposes. It, however, serves well enough for building mountain-huts, and temporary fences for cattle.

[^f30n1]: The enslaved generally were provided with a coarse brown linen known as osnaburg.  

[^f30n2]: In Greco-Roman mythology, Iris was the daughter of the Titan Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra; she is sometimes cited as the wife of Zephyrus, the west wind. Her name in Greek means rainbow. The goddess Juno took her to serve as her handmaid.  

[^f30n3]: Peleus' son is Achilles. In Book 18 of the *Iliad*, the god Hephaestus forges an elaborate shield for Achilles to replace the armor that was lost when Hector killed Patroclus.

The botanical name of the pine-apple is *bromelia*. Of the wild pine-apple,[^f31n10] or ananas bravo, hedges are made in South-America. It produces an inferior sort of fruit.

[^f31n1]: Alpha Canis Minoris, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor.  

[^f31n2]: Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-July and exits it in mid-August.  

[^f31n3]: The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*) originated in Central or South America. It was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean (Higman 188).  

[^f31n4]: Refers to Sagittarius, the southern zodiacal constellation depicted as a centaur aiming an arrow; popularly known as the Archer. By "the arrow's deadening power," Grainger means the November cold. Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-November and exits it in mid-December.  

[^f31n5]: Members of the genus *Citrus*. Citus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), limes (*Citrus aurantifolia*), and citrons (*Citrus medica*) to the Caribbean. He probably also carried lemons (*Citrus limon*) (Higman 175). 

[^f31n6]: Plantains \(family Musaceae\) are closely related to the banana, and they both formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved (although plantains were more important than bananas). Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. They subsequently were introduced to the Caribbean by the Spanish (Higman 134).  
[^f31n7]: Capricorn is the tenth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-December and exits it in mid-January.

> VER. 500. *Now children of this clime:*\] It is supposed that oranges, lemons, and limes were introduced into America by the Spaniards; but I am more inclined to believe they are natural to the climate. The Spaniards themselves probably had the two first from the Saracens,[^f35n4] for the Spanish noun *Naranja*, whence the English word *Orange*, is plainly Arabic.

> VER. 503. *the logwood-hedge.*\] Linnaeus's name for this useful tree is *Haemotoxylon*, but it is better known to physicians by that of *Lignum campechense*. Its virtues, as a medicine, and properties as an ingredient in dying, need not to be enumerated in this place. It makes a no less strong than beautiful hedge in the West-Indies, where it rises to a considerable height.

> VER. 508. *Nor shall the ricinus*\] This shrub is commonly called the physic-nut. It is generally divided into three kinds, the common, the French, and the Spanish, which differ from each other in their leaves and flowers, if not in their fruit or seeds. The plant from which the castor-oil is extracted is also called *Ricinus*, though it has no resemblance to any of the former, in leaves, flowers, or seeds. In one particular they all agree, *viz*. in their yielding to coction or expression a purgative or emetic[^f35n5] oil. The Spaniards name these nuts *Avellanas purgativas*; hence Ray[^f35n6] terms them *Avellanae purgatrices novi orbis*. By roasting they are supposed to lose part of their virulency, which is wholly destroyed, say some people, by taking out a leaf-like substance that is to be found between the lobes. The nut exceeds a walnut, or even an almond,[^f35n7] in sweetness, and yet three or four of them will operate briskly both up and down. The French call this useful shrub *Medecinier*. That species of it which bears red coral like flowers is named *Bellyach*[^f35n8] by the Barbadians; and its ripe seeds are supposed to be specific against melancholy.[^f35n9]

[^f35n1]: Logwood is the commericial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin, which produces blue, red, and purple colors.  

[^f35n2]: The flux is a general term for gastrointestinal disorders like dysentery (also known as the "bloody flux"). Dysentery remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Endemial means endemic or habitually present in a certain country or area.  

[^f35n3]: Grainger refers here to the physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century. The castor oil plant is probably native to northeastern Africa.  

[^f35n4]: Among the later Greeks and Romans, a name for the nomadic peoples of the Syro-Arabian desert; also used as a synonym for Arab and Muslim peoples.  

[^f35n5]: Having the power to produce vomiting. 

[^f35n6]: John Ray (1627-1705), English naturalist and botanist. Author of *Historia plantarum* (1686-1704), a three-volume encyclopedia of plants cataloging 18,600 species.  

[^f35n7]: The walnut (*Juglans regia*) has a native range stretching from the Balkan Peninsula to Iran. The almond (*Prunus dulcis*) is primarily native to western Asia. 

[^f35n8]: The bellyache bush (*Jatropha gossypiifolia*) has a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas.  

[^f35n9]: Prior to the eighteenth century, melancholy was understood within the framework of humoral theories of the body (articulated by Aristotle, Galen, and Hippocrates) as a disease caused by an excess of "black bile" and characterized by such emotions as fear or sadness without explicit cause. Use of the term had expanded by the time of Grainger's writing to speak more generally of physiological disturbance, listlessness, or dejection.

> VER. 510. *the acassee,*\] *Acacia*. This is a species of thorn; the juice of the root is supposed to be poisonous. Its seeds are contained in a pod or ligumen. It is of the class of the syngenesia. No astringent juice is extracted from it. Its trivial name is *Cashaw*. Tournefort[^f36n7] describes it in his voyage to the Levant.[^f36n8] Some call it the Holy Thorn, and others Sweet Brier. The half-ripe pod affords a strong cement; and the main stem, being wounded, produces a transparent gum, like the Arabic, to which tree this bears a strong resemblance.

> VER. 515. *the privet*\] *Ligustrum*. This shrub is sufficiently known. Its leaves and flowers make a good gargle in the aphthae,[^f36n9] and ulcered throat.

> VER. 520. *carnation fair.*\] This is indeed a most beautiful flowering shrub. It is a native of the West-Indies, and called, from a French governor, named Depoinci,[^f36n10] *Poinciana*. If permitted, it will grow twenty feet high; but, in order to make it a good fence, it should be kept low. It is always in blossom. Tho' not purgative, it is of the senna kind.[^f36n11] Its leaves and flowers are stomachic, carminative, and emmenagogue.[^f36n12] Some authors name it *Cauda pavonis*,[^f36n13] on account of its inimitable beauty; the flowers have a physicky smell. How it came to be called *Doodle-doo* I know not; the Barbadians more properly term it *Flower Fence*.[^f36n14] This plant grows also in Guinea.

[^f36n1]: Colic or painful stomach contractions.

[^f36n2]: Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn. 

[^f36n3]: Jewry, stiff-neck'd race. The book of Exodus contains a passage referring to Israelites as a "stiff-necked people" (32:9). The passage refers to the refusal of those accompanying Moses out of Egypt to give up their worship of idols. Yet the passage also has been cited by those seeking to characterize the Jewish people as obstinate for refusing to accept Christianity.  

[^f36n4]: Refers to any of a number of shrubs belonging to the genus *Ligustrum*. Native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia; commonly used for hedging. Some species are invasive.

[^f36n5]: Grampia's piny hills. The Grampian Mountains in Scotland.

[^f36n6]: *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, a shrub that produes showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved (2.124-125). The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.   

[^f36n7]: Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656-1708), French physician and botanist, author of *Éléments de botanique* (1694).

[^f36n10]: General Philippe de Lonvilliers, chevalier de Poincy (1584-1660), governor of the French Antilles from 1647 to 1660.  

[^f36n11]: The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.  

[^f36n12]: Grainger means that the plant is good for the stomach (stomachic), that it produces flatulence (carminative), and that it induces menstrual flow (emmenagogue).  

[^f36n13]: Peacock's tail.

> VER. 526. *seen the humming bird,*\] The humming bird is called *Picaflore* by the Spaniards, on account of its hovering over flowers, and sucking their juices, without lacerating, or even so much as discomposing their petals. Its Indian name, says Ulloa, is *Guinde*, though it is also known by the appellation of *Rabilargo* and *Lizongero*. By the Caribbeans it was called *Collobree*. It is common in all the warm parts of America. There are various species of them, all exceeding small, beautiful and bold. The crested one, though not so frequent, is yet more beautiful than the others. It is chiefly to be found in the woody parts of the mountains. Edwards[^f37n6] has described a very beautiful humming bird, with a long tail, which is a native of Surinam, but which I never saw in these islands. They are easily caught in rainy weather.

[^f37n5]: Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. Also known as nopal and commonly consumed by human beings and animals as food. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to eighteenth-century European naturalists because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects.

> grow in the barrenest soils, and on the tops of walls, if a small portion of earth be added. There are two sorts of it, one whose fruit is roundish and sweet, the other, which has more the shape of a fig, is sour. The former is sometimes eaten, but the other seldom. The French call them *Pomme de Raquette*. Both fruit and leaves are guarded with sharp prickles, and, even in the interior part of the fruit, there is one which must be removed before it is eaten. The leaves, which are half an inch thick, having a sort of pulp interposed between their surfaces, being deprived of their spines, and softened by the fire, make no bad poultice for inflammations. The juice of the fruit is an innocent fucus,[^f38n5] and is often used to tinge guava jellies. The opuntia, upon which the cochineal insect breeds, has no spines, and is cultivated with care in South-America, where it also grows wild. The prickly pear makes a strong fence, and is easily trimmed with a scymitar.[^f38n6] It grows naturally in some parts of Spain.[^f38n7]

> VER. 538. *wild liquorice*\] This is a scandent plant, from which the Negroes gather what they call *Jumbee Beeds*. These are about the size of pigeon-peas,[^f38n8] almost round, of a red colour, with a black speck on one extremity. They act as an emetic, but, being violent in their operation, great caution should be observed in using them. The leaves make a good pectoral drink[^f38n9] in disorders of the breast. By the French it is named *Petit Panacoco*, to distinguish it from a large tree, which bears seeds of the same colours, only much bigger. This tree is a species of black ebony.[^f38n10]

[^f38n1]: Wild liquorice (*Abrus precatorius*) is a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration. *Abrus precatorius* is native to Africa, Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific region.  

[^f38n2]: Climbing, ascending.

[^f38n4]: Gilmore suggests that Christobelle refers to Grainger's wife, Daniel Matthew Burt. This seems likely, especially if one reads "Christobelle" as "Belle of St. Christopher." Lines 544-547 refer to Grainger's long-standing wish that he might one day own his own plantation. See, for example, his 25 March 1765 letter to Bishop Thomas Percy (Nichols 288).

[^f38n7]: *Opuntia ficus-indica*, which is native to Mexico, was introduced to Spain by Columbus upon his return from his first voyage.  

[^f38n8]: *Cajanus cajan*. Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of the enslaved because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.

[^f38n9]: Pectoral drinks aid in digestion.

[^f38n10]: Ebony refers to various Asian and African trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.

> VER. 572. *yellow deaths*\] The yellow fever, to which Europeans of a sanguine habit of body, and who exceed in drinking or exercise, are liable on their arrival in the West Indies. The French call it *Maladie de Siame*, or more properly, *La Fievre des Matelots*. Those who have lived any time in the islands are no more subject to this disease than the Creoles,[^f40n3] whence, however, some physicians have too hastily concluded, that it was of foreign extraction.

[^f40n1]: Yellow fever, a viral disease transmitted by the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito, occurs mostly in tropical climates and is characterized by aches, fever, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. This disease was extremely deadly to newcomers from Europe. Eighteenth-century physicians did not understand the mechanisms via which yellow fever was caused or transmitted, but they took note of immunological patterns in which people who had lived in the Caribbean seemed immune to the disease, while those who had not were susceptible. They further believed, erroneously, that Africans and Afro-Caribbeans had an innate immunity to yellow fever.  

[^f40n2]: Grainger spends the next few pages describing Montano, a fictional planter whom he lauds for treating his slaves humanely. It should be noted that this behavior, though presented as virtuous, is justified on economic grounds.  

[^f40n3]: In the eighteenth century, the term creole was used to refer to individuals born in the Americas, regardless of ancestry.

> VER. 596. *cassada,*\] Cassavi, cassava, is called *Jatropha* by botanists. Its meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous. There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*.[^f41n3] The colour of its root is white, like a parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the Indians prepare many wholesome dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and, being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob. Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The French name it *Manihot*, *Magnoc*, and *Manioc*, and the Spaniards *Mandiocha*. It is pretended that all creatures but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink[^f41n4] is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There is one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*.[^f41n5]

> VER. 597. *tanies:*\] This wholesome root, in some of the islands, is called *Edda*: Its botanical name is *Arum maximum AEgyptiacum*. There are three species of tanies, the blue, the scratching, and that which is commonly roasted. The blossoms of all three are very fragrant, in a morning or evening. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad.[^f41n6] The root makes a good broth in dysenteric complaints. They are seldom so large as the yam, but most people think them preferable in point of taste.

[^f41n1]: Cassava \(*Manihot esculenta*\), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, which was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. One of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era; subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Nevertheless, cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw root is poisonous to human beings. Cassava has advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads (Higman 61-69).  

[^f41n2]: Roots commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. The tanie, tannia, or yautia is technically the species *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*, but it was often confused with taro or eddo (*Colocasia esculenta*), another common root crop cultivated by the enslaved. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* has a native range extending from Costa Rica to tropical South America. *Colocasia esculenta* originated in southeastern or southern Central Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 CE. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food (Higman 82-86).  

[^f41n3]: Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour (Higman 62).   

[^f41n4]: There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino (Higman 69).  

[^f41n5]: Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America (now the name of the capital of French Guiana).  

[^f41n6]: Tannia and taro leaves were primarily consumed by the enslaved because they contained needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate. These crystals irritated the mouth and throat when eaten, and the leaves had to be boiled for a long period of time to reduce what was known as the "scratching" effect (Higman 86-87).

> VER. 598. *to the soursop*\] The true Indian name of this tree is *Suirsaak*. It grows in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds. Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an acid. It is one of the *Anonas*, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples.[^f42n5] The leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the West-Indies. The botanical name is *Guanabanus*. The French call it *Petit Corosol*, or *Coeur de Boeuf*, to which the fruit bears a resemblance. The root, being reduced to a powder, and snuffed up the nose, produces the same effect as tobacco. Taken by the mouth, the Indians pretend it is a specific in the epilepsy.

> VER. 601. *cotton*\] The fine down, which this shrub produces to invelope its seeds, is sufficiently known. The English, Italian, and French names, evidently are derived from the Arabic *Algodon*, as the Spaniards at this day call it. It was first brought by the Arabians into the Levant, where it is now cultivated with great success. Authors mention four species of cotton, but they confound the silk-cotton tree, or *Ceiba*, among them. The flower of the West-India cotton-shrub is yellow, and campanulated.[^f42n6] It produces twice every year. That of Cayenne is the best of any that comes from America. This plant is very apt to be destroyed by a grub within a short time; bating that, it is a profitable production. Pliny mentions *Gossipium*, which is the common botanical name of cotton. It is likewise called *Zylon*. Martinus, in his Philological Lexicon,[^f42n7] derives cotton from the Hebrew word &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; *Katon*, (or, as pronounced by the German-Jews, *Kotoun*.)

[^f42n2]: Refers to tobacco, which Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) was sometimes credited with introducing to England. Raleigh was an English courtier during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, as well as an explorer and author who obtained a patent for and helped to organize the expeditions to Roanoke in 1585 and 1587. He set out for South America in 1595, exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela, and again in 1617 to search for the famed city of El Dorado. He was executed for treason in 1618. He is the author of *Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana* (1596).   

[^f42n3]: Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World.  

[^f42n4]: A grove of cacao trees. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[^f42n5]: The custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree whose native range is Mexico to northeastern Venezuela. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (Higman 202). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.

> the provinces of South America, and a drink made from it was the common food of the Indians before the Spaniards came among them, who were some time in those countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed, that the Indian chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I much doubt whether the Europeans have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and other hot ingredients.[^f43n2] The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is streight and handsome. The pods, which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of the size of a slatted olive,[^f43n3] grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree loves a moist, rich and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes screen them by a hardier tree, which the Spaniards aptly term *Madre de Cacao*.[^f43n4] They may be planted fifteen or twenty feet distant, though some advise to plant them much nearer, and perhaps wisely; for it is an easy matter to thin them, when they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, *&c*. Some recommend planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young, to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally three years before they produce good pods;[^f43n5] but, in six years, they are in highest perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.[^f43n6] There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour and goodness of their nuts.[^f43n7] That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. None of the species grow in Peru. Its alimentary, as well as physical properties, are sufficiently known. This word is Indian.[^f43n8]

The inhabitants about the mouth of the Red-Sea were taught the use of it by the Persians, say authors, in the fifteenth century; and the coffee-shrub was gradually introduced into Arabia Felix,[^f43n9] whence it passed into Egypt, Syria, and lastly Constantinople.[^f43n10] The Turks, though so excessively fond of coffee, have not known it much above eighty years;[^f43n11] whereas the English have been acquainted therewith for upwards of an hundred, one

[^f43n1]: Gilmore suggests that these names reference Grainger's wife, whose first name was Daniel ("Daniel" sounds like "Danae").  

[^f43n2]: The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Mexico and Belize, as well as other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which have a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry.  

[^f43n3]: The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years.    

[^f43n4]: *Gliricidia sepium*. Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[^f43n5]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[^f43n6]: The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) has a native range extending from Himalaya to northern Thailand.  

[^f43n7]: There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

[^f43n8]: "Cacao" is derived from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."

This plant is cultivated in the West-Indies, particularly by the French, with great success; but the berry from thence is not equal to that from Mocha.[^f44n8] It is a species of Arabian jasmine; the flower is particularly redolent, and from it a pleasant cordial water is distilled. It produces fruit twice every year; but the shrub must be three years old before any can be gathered. It should not be allowed to grow above six foot high. It is very apt to be destroyed by a large fly, which the French call *Mouche a caffe*; as well as by the white grub, which they name *Puceron*.[^f44n9] Its medical and alimentary qualities are as generally known as those of tea.[^f44n10]

[^f44n4]: Ethiop and Ethiopia were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Ethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Ethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about “washing the Ethiopian” or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.

[^f44n9]: According to Gilmore, the large fly is possibly *Xyleutes (Psychonoctua) lillianae*, and the white grub is possibly *Planococcus citri* (Gilmore cites Kevan for this information).  

[^f44n10]: *Camellia sinensis* is the species from which commercially produced tea is derived. Its native range is Southeastern Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

An excellent vinegar may be made from the fruit; but the Creoles chiefly preserve it with sugar, as the Spaniards with salt. A pleasant syrup may be made from it. The name is, in Arabic, *Tamara*. The Antients were not acquainted therewith; for the Arabians first introduced tamarinds into physic; it is a native of the East as well as of the West-Indies and South-America, where different provinces call it by different names. Its cathartic[^f45n2] qualities are well known. It is good in sea-sickness. The botanical name is *Tamarindus*.

ADVERTISEMENT to BOOK II.  

THE following Book having been originally addressed to WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq; and by him approved of; the Author should deem it a kind of poetical sacrilege, now, to address it to any other. To his memory, therefore, be it sacred; as a small but sincere testimony of the high opinion the Author entertained of that Gentleman's genius and manners; and as the only return now, alas! in his power to make, for the friendship wherewith Mr. SHENSTONE had condescended to honour him.[^f51n1]

[^f51n1]: William Shenstone (1714-1763), English poet and famed innovator of landscape gardening, which he practiced on his estate, The Leasowes. Grainger enclosed a draft of *The Sugar-Cane* in a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, asking he and Shenstone to read and comment on it. He added that "The second book you will see is addressed to our friend at the Leasowes; and I must tell you it is my favourite of the whole" (Nichols 279).

BOOK II.  

- ENOUGH of culture.—A less pleasing theme,  
- What ills await the ripening Cane, demands  
- My serious numbers: these, the thoughtful Muse  
- Hath oft beheld, deep-pierc'd with generous woe.  
- For she, poor exile! boasts no waving crops;[^f53n1] [5]  
- For her no circling mules press dulcet streams;[^f53n2]  
- No Negro-band huge foaming coppers[^f53n3] skim;  
- Nor fermentation \(wine's dread fire\) for her,  
- With Vulcan's[^f53n4] aid, from Cane a spirit draws,  
- Potent to quell the madness of despair. [10]  
- Yet, oft, the range she walks, at shut of eve;  

[^f53n1]: The opening lines of Book II parallel Grainger's experience in the Caribbean. Having married into a planter family, he felt isolated from his London friends, and he hoped one day to have a plantation of his own, though he never did. Writing to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy on 29 February 1766, Grainger lamented that "I am lost, murdered, for want of company" (Nichols 293).  

[^f53n2]: Animals like mules, horses, and cattle were used to power sugar mills if wind and water were not readily available.  

[^f53n3]: Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.  

[^f53n4]: Roman god of fire. Here, Grainger refers to the use of fire in the process of distilling spirits (rum) from fermented molasses.

- Oft sees red lightning at the midnight-hour,  
- When nod the watches, stream along the sky;  
- Not innocent, as what the learned call  
- The Boreal morn,[^f54n1] which, through the azure air, [15]  
- Flashes its tremulous rays, in painted streaks,  
- While o'er night's veil her lucid tresses flow:  
- Nor quits the Muse her walk, immers'd in thought,  
- How she the planter, haply, may advise;  
- Till tardy morn unbar the gates of light, [20]  
- And, opening on the main with sultry beam,  
- To burnish'd silver turns the blue-green wave.  

- SAY, will my SHENSTONE lend a patient ear,  
- And weep at woes unknown to Britain's Isle?  
- Yes, thou wilt weep; for pity chose thy breast, [25]

- DESTRUCTIVE, on the upland sugar-groves  
- The monkey-nation[^f55n1] preys: from rocky heights, [35]

- Pour o'er the Cane-grove. Luckless he to whom  
- That land pertains! in evil hour, perhaps, [40]  
- And thoughtless of to-morrow, on a die

- However baited: Treble every watch,  
- And well with arms provide them; faithful dogs, [50]  
- Of nose sagacious, on their footsteps wait.  

> VER. 46. *peculiar pest*\] The monkeys which are now so numerous in the mountainous parts of St. Christopher, were brought thither by the French when they possessed half that island. This circumstance we learn from *Pere Labat*,[^f55n7] who farther tells us, that they are a most delicate food. The English-Negroes are very fond of them, but the White-inhabitants do not eat them. They do a great deal of mischief in St. Kitts, destroying many thousand pounds *Sterling*'s worth of Canes every year.

[^f55n1]: Monkeys are not indigenous to St. Kitts, but the vervet or African green monkey (*Cercopithecus aethiops*) had been introduced by the seventeenth century. Vervets most likely arrived in the Caribbean via slave ships from Africa. They quickly came to be considered pests because they established themselves in large numbers on the island and traveled around it in troops, raiding colonists' crops. Today, the St. Kitts vervet population exceeds the human one, and vervets are still known for destroying farmers' crops (and stealing tourists' cocktails). Controversially, many of the vervets are now killed or trapped to serve in medical experiments.  

[^f55n2]: Leaps or capers, as made in dancing or playing.  

[^f55n3]: Sugar. 

[^f55n4]: Grainger warns that despite the fact that sugar plantations seem like sure investments with guaranteed profits, they nevertheless require expert knowledge and labor to succeed.   

[^f55n5]: Also droll, a buffoon or jester.  

[^f55n6]: Indigenous name for St. Kitts.  

[^f55n7]: Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Libertated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

- Quickly the unequal conflict they decline,

> VER. 64. *These to destroy*\] Rats, *&c.* are not natives of America, but came by shipping from Europe. They breed in the ground, under loose rocks and bushes. Durante, a Roman, who was physician to Pope Sixtus Quintus,[^f56n4] and who wrote a Latin poem on the preservation of health, enumerates domestic rats among animals that may be eaten with safety. But if these are wholesome, cane-rats must be much more delicate, as well as more nourishing. Accordingly we find most field Negroes fond of them, and I have heard that straps of cane-rats are publicly sold in the markets of Jamaica.[^f56n5]

[^f56n1]: Hostile French forces. Here, Grainger makes an analogy between the vervet monkeys and the French during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), the first truly global war that resulted in the establishment of Britain as the preeminent maritime and colonial power.

[^f56n2]: Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.

[^f56n3]: Refers either to the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) or the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), two Old World species of rats that arrived in the Caribbean with colonization and are now considered invasive species. There also was a rat known as the Nevis rice rat (*Pennatomys nivalis*) that was native to Nevis, St. Kitts, and St. Eustatius, but there are no definitive reports of its existence from the colonial era. The Nevis rice rat is now considered extinct. This line of the poem also relates to one of the most famous and perhaps apocryphal stories about the reception and publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. In his *Life of Johnson*, James Boswell recalls a reading of a manuscript draft of the poem that took place at the home of painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The line, "Now, Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. In response, Grainger deleted the word "rats" from the poem and replaced it with "whisker'd vermine-race" (Irlam 390-391). 

[^f56n4]: Castore Durante da Gualdo (1529-1590), botanist and physician to the Popes Gregory XIII and Sixtus V. Author of *Herbaria nuovo* (1585) and *Il tesoro della sanità* (1586).

[^f56n5]: Grainger may have been referring to a passage from Hans Sloane's *A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725) that reads, "Rats are likewise sold by the dozen, and when they have been bred amongst the Sugar-Canes, are thought by some discerning people very delicious Victuals" (1.xx). Sloane seems to imply that all Jamaicans, and not just the enslaved, ate rats.

- Nor kill the winding snake, thy foes they eat.
- Thus, on the mangrove-banks[^f57n1] of Guayaquil,[^f57n2]

- Dread alligators[^f57n4] would alone possess.
- Thy foes, the teeth-fil'd Ibbos[^f57n5] also love; [75]
- Nor thou their wayward appetite restrain.

> VER. 69. *mangrove-banks*\] This tree, which botanists call *Rizophora*, grows in marshy soils, and on the sides of rivers; and, as the branches take root, they frequently render narrow streams impassable to boats. Osyters often adhere to their roots, *&c*. The French name of this strange water-shrub is *Paltuvier*. The species meant here is the red mangrove.

> VER. 74. *Dread alligators*\] This dreadful animal is amphibious, and seldom lays fewer than 100 eggs. These she carefully covers with sand. But, notwithstanding this precaution, the gallinazo (a large species of carrion-crow) conceals itself among the thick boughs of the neighbouring trees, and thus often discovers the hoard of the alligator, which she no sooner leaves, than the gallinazo souses down upon it, and greedily scraping off the sand, regales on its contents. Nor is the male alligator less an enemy to the increase of his own horrid brood, than these useful birds; for, when Instinct prompts the female to let her young fry out by breaking the eggs, he never fails to accompany her, and to devour as many of them as he can: So that the mother scarce ever escapes into the river with more than five out of all her hundred. Thus providence doubly prevents the otherwise immense propagation of that voracious animal, on the banks of the river Guayaquil; for the gallinazo is not always found, where alligators are. *Ulloa*.[^f57n6]

> VER. 75. *teeth-fil'd Ibbos*\] Or *Ebbos*, as they are more commonly called, are a numerous nation. Many of them have their teeth filed, and blackened in an extraordinary manner. They make good slaves when bought young; but are, in ge-

[^f57n1]: Mangroves are trees of the genus *Rhizophora*, which contains well over a hundred species, most native to the Old World but some native to the New. Mangroves can thrive in soils of varying levels of salinity and have colonized tropical and subtropical coastlines to form forests and thickets there.

[^f57n2]: Gulf and river in Ecuador leading to the city of Guayaquil. The modern name of the river is the Rio Guayas.

[^f57n3]: The American black vulture (*Coragyps atratus*), whose native range includes North, Central, and South America.

[^f57n4]: The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.

[^f57n5]: Igbo refers to a language spoken in the Bight of Biafra (now the Bight of Bonny), a bay on the western Atlantic coast of Africa bounded by Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and northwestern Gabon. The Bight of Biafra was a major slave-trading region in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, and people who spoke Igbo came to be designated as Igbo by slave traders and planters. Some of these people may have thought of themselves as Igbo as well, while others may simply have accepted or been forced to accept the term as a designation, even though they would have identified themselves by their villages or districts of origin instead. Since many people who ended up at the Bight of Biafra and other ports on the western Atlantic coast had made long journeys from inland Africa and picked up various languages along the way, those who identified as Igbo also may have learned Igbo during the process and been participating in ethnogenesis (the formation and development of ethnic groupings).

[^f57n6]: Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).

[^f58n1]: A chemical compound used as rat poison.

[^f58n2]: Cassava \(*Manihot esculenta*\), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, is a plant that is poisonous to human beings in raw form: its roots contain cyanide. Rats apparently could eat it without being unduly affected, however, since Grainger recommends mixing cassava with Misnian arsenic to poison them. In fact, rats are recognized as major cassava pests today. In spite of their toxicity, cassava roots served as one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era, and they were subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. The poison in the roots can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Cassava's advantages are significant enough that they offset its toxic nature: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling (Higman 61-69).

> VER. 95. *'Tis safer then to mingle nightshade's juice*\] See the article *Solanum* in Newman's Chemistry published by Dr. Lewis.[^f59n4] There is a species of East-India[^f59n5] animal, called a *Mungoes*,[^f59n6] which bears a natural antipathy to rats. Its introduction into the Sugar-Islands would, probably, effectuate the extirpation of this destructive vermin.

[^f59n1]: Nightshade most likely refers to *Atropa belladonna*, a poisonous plant also known as deadly nightshade or belladonna. The foliage, fruits, and roots are all highly toxic, and consuming only ten berries can kill an adult human. Its native range is England to central and southern Europe to Iran.

[^f59n2]: Enslaved children. Almost all enslaved persons on the plantation were forced to work, including the young. The tasks children were assigned included weeding, cutting grass to feed the cattle, washing clothes, and serving in the main house.

[^f59n4]: William Lewis (bap. 1708-d. 1781) was an English physician and experimental chemist. Author of *Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann, M.D.* (1759). Neumann (1683-1737) was a German chemist.

[^f59n5]: The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.

[^f59n6]: The mongoose refers to a small carnivore and member of the family *Herpestidae*. There are many different species of mongoose, all native to the Old World. After the eighteenth century, the mongoose was purposefully introduced to the Caribbean and Pacific islands to exterminate the rat population. Because the mongoose also eats birds, amphibians, and reptiles, it has contributed to the destruction of local biodiversity on those islands and is considered an invasive species.

> VER. 119. *Nor let rude hands the knotted grass profane*,\] This is truly a powerful vermifuge;[^f60n9] but, uncautiously administered, has often proved mortal. The juice of it clarified, is sometimes given; but a decoction of it is greatly preferable. Its botanical name is *Spigelia*.

> VER. 123. *The cow-itch also save*;\] This extraordinary vine should not be permitted to grow in a Cane-piece; for Negroes have been known to fire the Canes, to save themselves from the torture which attends working in grounds where it has abounded. Mixed with melasses,[^f60n10] it is a safe and excellent vermifuge. Its seeds, which resemble blackish small beans, are purgative. Its flower is purple; and its pods, on which the stinging brown *Setae*[^f60n11] are found, are as large as a full-grown English field-pea.[^f60n12] 

[^f60n1]: Most likely *Argemone mexicana*, the seeds of which are purgative. Also known as the Mexican prickly poppy; native to the tropical Americas.

[^f60n2]: May refer to the Zenaida dove (*Zenaida aurita*), a bird native to the Caribbean.

[^f60n3]: Probably *Spigelia anthelmia*, a plant known for its ability to rid the body of intestinal parasites, including tapeworms. Its native range is the tropical and subtropical Americas.

[^f60n4]: An endemic disease, meaning one that is habitually prevalent in a certain country or locale.

[^f60n5]: Cowitch \(*Mucuna pruriens*\), a viny plant that produces severe itching after contact with skin. Was used on sugar plantations as compost, forage, and cattle feed. Its seeds destroy intestinal parasites. Likely native to tropical Asia and possibly Africa.

> VER. 128. *Planter, thou may'st the humble chickweed*\] There are two kinds of chickweed, which grow spontaneously in the Caribbees, and both possess very considerable virtues, particularly that which botanists call *Cajacia*, and which the Spaniards emphatically name *Erudos Cobres*, or Snakeweed,[^f61n5] on account of its remarkable qualities against poisonous bites. It is really of use against fish-poison; as is also the sensitive plant, which the Spaniards prettily call the *Vergonzoza*, the Bashful, and *La Donzella*, or the Maiden. There are many kinds of this extraordinary plant, which grow every where in the Islands and South-America. The botanical name of the former is *Alsine*, and that of the latter *Mimosa*.

> VER. 130. *Not the confection*\] This medicine is called *Mithridatium*,[^f61n6] in honour of Mithridates king of Pontus; who, by using it constantly, had secured himself from the effects of poison, in such a manner, that, when he actually attempted to put an end to his life, by that means, he failed in his purpose. So, at least, Pliny[^f61n7] informs us. But we happily are not obliged to believe, implicitly, whatever that elaborate compiler has told us. When poisons immediately operate on the nervous system, and their effects are to be expelled by the skin, this electuary[^f61n8] is no contemptible antidote. But how many poisons do we know at present, which produce their effects in a different manner? and, from the acounts of authors, we have reason to be persuaded, that the antients were not much behind us in their variety of poisons. If, therefore, the King of Pontus had really intended to have destroyed himself, he could have been at no loss for the means, notwithstanding the daily use of this antidote.

> VER. 131. *Not the bless'd apple*\] Authors are not agreed what the apple is, to which Virgil attributes such remarkable virtues, nor is it indeed possible they ever

[^f61n1]: *Stellaria media*, a plant native to Europe.

[^f61n2]: Grainger refers to the sensitive plant \(*Mimosa pudica*\), the leaves of which fold up when touched. It is native to the tropical Americas and became an object of fascination to European naturalists. 

[^f61n3]: Mithridates \(132-63 BCE\) ruled Pontus in modern-day Turkey from 120-63 BCE. His attempts to expand his empire led to three wars against the Roman army. Following a mutiny by his troops, he committed suicide.  

[^f61n4]: Media was the location of hot springs that the Romans called the sacred waters of Hercules.

[^f61n5]: May be *Euphorbia hyssopifolia*, a plant whose native range is the tropical and subtropical Americas.

[^f61n6]: A medicine long believed to be a universal antidote to poison.  

[^f61n7]: Gaius Plinius Secundus or Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), author of *Historia Naturalis*.

> VER. 149. *For not the costly root*,\] Some medical writers have bestowed the high appellation of *Donum Dei*[^f62n6] on rhubarb.[^f62n7]

[^f62n1]: Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Georgics*, and the *Aeneid*.

[^f62n2]: Mythical birds usually identified with kingfishers (genus *Halcyon*) that were believed to calm the seas in order to breed in floating nests. The phrase "Halcyon days" previously designated a fourteen-day period around the winter solstice that supposedly was the time when the ocean was becalmed by the birds. It now designates more generally a period of time in the past that was idyllic and peaceful.

[^f62n3]: Grainger is probably not referring to a specific species of fish but rather to ciguatera, a disease long associated with the consumption of predatory fish in the Caribbean. Ciguatera is a toxin produced by a marine microalgae called *Gambierdiscus toxicus*, and, like mercury, it becomes more concentrated in fish as they rise in the food chain. Symptoms of ciguatera include nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years.  

[^f62n4]: Also known as verbena (*Verbena officinalis*), an herbal shrub whose native range is the Old World and Australia.

[^f62n5]: *Abrus precatorius*, a slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison, since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration. *Abrus precatorius* is native to Africa, Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific region.

[^f62n6]: Gift of god.

[^f62n7]: *Rheum rhabarbarum*, a plant whose native range includes southern Siberia and northern and central China. Traditionally used for indigestion and bowel complaints; now commonly used as a fruit.

[^f63n1]: The Volga is a river in western Russia that connects to the Baltic, Moscow, and Black Seas before flowing into the Caspian Sea.

[^f63n2]: Locusts, one of several species of acridids (family Acrididae) that are known for swarming and migrating and causing great damage to crops. 

[^f63n3]: May be *Diachlorus ferrugatus*, a small biting fly native to Central America and the southeastern United States.

[^f63n4]: The cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*) is the source of a highly prized red dye made from the dried bodies of the female. The cochineal insect is native to tropical and subtropical Mexico and South America and was used in those places in the precolonial era to dye textiles and other objects. It became an important Atlantic commodity in the eighteenth century, with most of the supply still coming from indigenous sources. The red coats of British officers were dyed with cochineal.

> VER. 171. *Thus cochinille*\] This is a Spanish word. For the manner of propagating this useful insect, see Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica.[^f64n6] It was long believed in Europe to be a seed, or vegetable production. The botanical name of the plant on which the cochinille feeds, is *Opuntia maxima*, *folio oblongo*, *majore*, *spinulis obtusis*, *mollibus et innocentibus obsito*, *flore*, *striis rubris variegato*. Sloane.

[^f64n1]: Cactus plant of the genus *Opuntia*, some species of which served as food plants for the cochineal insect. There are over a hundred species of *Opuntia* distributed throughout the Americas. *Opuntia* are also known as prickly pear cacti or nopal, the pads and fruit of which are commonly consumed by human beings and animals as food. 

[^f64n2]: James Wolfe (1727-1759), English army officer. Like Grainger, he served in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and during the Scottish Jacobite Rising of 1745. Appointed Major-General in North America in 1758, Wolfe is perhaps best known for defeating French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, marquis de Montcalm, and the French army on the Plains of Abraham outside of Quebec city in September 1759. Wolfe was fatally wounded during the battle, but his victory brought an end to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763).  

[^f64n3]: George III (1738-1820), king of Britain from 1760 to 1820.

[^f64n4]: Father killer. Here, Grainger refers to parasites—and perhaps puns on the similarities between "paracide" and "parasite"—that kill the plants on which they feed (in this case, the sugar cane). Grainger may be referring to the sugar cane borer (*Diatraea saccharalis*), a moth native to South and Central America whose larvae bore holes in sugar cane plants and do great damage on plantations.

[^f64n5]: Augeas, king of Elis, owned the stables that Hercules cleaned in the course of completing one of his twelve labors. Grainger is comparing the labor of washing every leaf in a cane field with the labors of Hercules, who cleaned the stables by redirecting the Alpheus and Peneus rivers through them.

[^f64n6]: Hans Sloane (1660-1753) was an Irish physician, naturalist, and collector who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 with Christopher Monck, second duke of Albemarle and newly appointed governor of Jamaica. During his stay in Jamaica, Sloane amassed an extensive collection of natural specimens, including plants, that later served as the basis for his natural history, *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). Sloane also succeeded Isaac Newton as president of the Royal Society in 1727. Upon his death, he bequeathed his extensive collections, which he had made considerable additions to after returning from Jamaica, to the British nation. These served as the founding collections of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum in London. Sloane discusses the propagation of cochineal in his *Voyage* (2.208).

> VER. 205. *Tho' seasons*\] Without a rainy season, the Sugar-cane could not be cultivated to any advantage: For what Pliny the Elder writes of another plant may be applied to this, *Gaudet irriguis, et toto anno bibere amat*.

> VER. 205. *this pestilence*\] It must, however, be confessed, that the blast is less frequent in lands naturally rich, or such as are made so by well-rotted manure.

[^f65n1]: Kent is a county in southeastern England. 

[^f65n2]: In Greek mythology, the east wind. 

[^f65n3]: In Greek mythology, the north wind.

[^f65n4]: According to Gilmore, Grainger refers in these lines to the arrival of the hop aphid or Damson hop aphid (*Phorodon humuli*) to Kentish hop fields. These flies traveled on the wind and caused great damage to crops. 

[^f65n5]: Gilmore identifies the blast as the disease that also has been called the black blight. It results from an infestation by the West Indian cane fly (*Saccharosydne saccharivora*). 

[^f65n6]: Period of immaturity.

In like manner, the panspan[^f66n5] is destitute of foliage when covered with flowers. The latter is a species of jessamine, and grows as large as an apple-tree.

[^f66n1]: The Virgin Islands are a group of islands situated to the east of Puerto Rico and northwest of St. Kitts. Now divided into the British Virgin Islands and the US Virgin Islands.

[^f66n2]: According to Gilmore, *Spondias purpurea*. Its native range is Mexico to northern Colombia.  

[^f66n3]: Gem-like, brilliant, glittering.

[^f66n4]: Ant colonies were often represented as model republics in early modern and eighteenth-century accounts because of their ability to work together for the collective good. For example, in his *True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657), Richard Ligon observed that he once put a pot filled with sugar in the middle of a larger dish of water to see whether the ants would be able to find and retrieve the sugar. As he reported, the ants began venturing into the water even though they could not swim, so that their dead bodies could form a bridge for the others to use to access the sugar. The ants thereby "neglect[ed] their lives for the good of the publique" (64).

[^f66n5]: According to Gilmore, the panspan or hog plum is *Spondias mombin*. Its native range is Mexico to the tropical Americas.

[^f69n1]: In a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, Grainger notes that he had almost finished writing *The Sugar-Cane* and that this set-piece on the hurricane was one of the last sections that needed to be completed: "You may remember I some time ago metioned my being engaged in a work of some length and difficulty. Lately I completed it, at least for the present, though no less than a Georgic, and in four books too. It is called the 'Cane Piece,' and was composed mostly in my rides to the different parts of the island to visit my patients. I now send you the whole; only as I have seen no hurricane, and have not yet had time to arrange my remarks on a fire by night in a cane field, those parts in the second book are incomplete" (Nichols 278).

[^f69n2]: welkin. Sky, firmament.

[^f69n3]: Etna, Europe's highest active volcano, located in Sicily.

[^f69n4]: Grainger is using astrological signs to designate peak hurricane season. The Virgin names Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-August and exits it in mid-September. Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-September and exits it in mid-October. Scorpio is the eight sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-October and exits it in mid-November.

[^f73n1]: Corruscations are vibratory or quivering flashes of light; lightning.

[^f73n2]: Grainger refers to the unsuitability of some Old World plants to the tropical Caribbean climate. Europeans nevertheless transplanted as many familiar Old World plants as they could to the Caribbean and, in doing so, transformed its ecology. They transplanted animals and diseases as well. This transplantation process is now known as the Columbian Exchange and included the movement of plants, animals, and diseases in both directions across the Atlantic.  

[^f73n3]: Refers to the doldrums, also called intertropical convergence zones, where prevailing (or trade) winds disappear and ships become immobile for days on end.

There are few mountainous islands in that part of the globe without them, and those probably will destroy them in time. I saw much sulphur and alum[^f74n4] in the solfaterre at Mountserrat. The stream that runs through it, is almost as hot as boiling water, and its steams soon blacken silver, *&c*.

[^f76n1]: From here to the end of Book 2, Grainger tells the fictional love story of Junio and Theana. The story itself is conventional, borrowing from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*, as well as the story of Inkle and Yarico, first told by Richard Ligon in *A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657) and retold as a sentimental tale in Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's *The Spectator* (No. 11, 13 March 1711). 

[^76n2]: It was common practice for planters to send their children to Britain for education. Many of the children who were sent there, however, never returned to the Caribbean.  

[^f76n3]: The Thames river. Here, used to mean England.   

[^f76n4]: Eton, a prestigious English boarding school for boys founded in the fifteenth century. 

[^f76n5]: Egyptian goddess associated with agriculture and marriage. Isis was eventually apropriated into Greek and Roman mythology, becoming a common figure in eighteenth-century British poetry. In the context of these lines, Isis is used as a name for the Thames as it passes through Oxford.

- He oft distinguish'd; and for whom he oft
- Had climb'd the bending coco's airy height,
- To rob it of its nectar; which the maid,

> VER. 438. *the bending coco's*\] The coco-nut tree is of the palm genus; there are several species of them, which grow naturally in the Torrid Zone.[^f77n1] The coco-nut tree is, by no means, so useful as travellers have represented it. The wood is of little or no service, being spungy, and the brown covering of the nuts is of too rough a texture to serve as apparel. The shell of the nut receives a good polish; and, having a handle put to it, is commonly used to drink water out of. The milk, or water of the nut, is cooling and pleasant; but, if drunk too freely, will frequently occasion a pain in the stomach. A salutary oil may be extracted from the kernel; which, if old, and eaten too plentifully, is apt to produce a shortness of breathing. A species of arrack[^f77n2] is made from this tree, in the East-Indies. The largest coco-nut trees grow on the banks of the river Oronoko.[^f77n3] They thrive best near the sea, and look beautiful at a distance. They afford no great shade. Ripe nuts have been produced from them in three years after planting. The nuts should be macerated in water, before they are put in the ground. Coco is an Indian name; the Spaniards call it also *palma de las Indias*; as the smallest kind, whose nuts are less than walnuts, is termed by them *Coquillo*. This grows in Chili,[^f77n4] and the nuts are esteemed more delicate than those of a larger size. In the Maldivy Islands,[^f77n5] it is pretended, they not only build houses of the coco-nut tree, but also vessels, with all their rigging; nay, and load them too with wine, oil, vinegar, black sugar,[^f77n6] fruit, and strong water,[^f77n7] from the same tree. If this be true, the Maldivian coco-nut trees must differ widely from those that grow in the West-Indies. The coco[^f77n8] must not be confounded with the coco-nut tree. That shrub grows in the hottest and moistest vales of the Andes. Its leaf, which is gathered two or three times a year, is much coveted by the natives of South-America, who will travel great journeys upon a single handful of the leaves, which they do not swallow, but only chew. It is of an unpleasant taste, but, by use, soon grows agreeable. Some authors have also confounded the coco-nut palm, with the coco, or chocolate-tree.[^f77n9] The French call the coco-nut tree, *Cocotier*. Its stem, which is very lofty, is always bent; for which reason it looks better in an orchard than in a regular garden. As one limb fades, another shoots up in the center, like a pike. The botanical name is *Palma indica*, *coccifera*, *angulosa*.

[^f77n1]: A theoretical climatic zone lying between between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer; the tropics. The ancients believed that the torrid zone was uninhabitable. While the colonization of the Caribbean proved otherwise, many colonists, naturalists, and others in the eighteenth century continued to believe that the tropics could induce what they called degeneration or the degradation of their bodies and faculties. Furthermore, the fear of degeneration was intertwined with theories of geographic and racial difference, since it was usually argued that New World forms of nature, including human beings, were inferior to Old World ones and that Europeans hence would become inferior themselves by inhabiting the New World.  

[^f77n2]: Also arak, an alcohol distilled from the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).

[^f77n3]: The Orinoco river, which passes through modern Colombia and Venezuala.  

[^f77n4]: Chile. 

[^f77n5]: The Maldives archipelago, which is in the Indian Ocean. Now the Republic of Maldives.

[^f77n6]: Possibly jaggery, a coarse, dark brown sugar made by evaporation from the sap of various kinds of palm.

[^f77n7]: Distilled liquor. 

[^f77n8]: The coca plant, the source of cocaine. Two species of coca are now in cultivation: *Erythroxylum coca*, whose native range is western South America, and *Erythroxylum novogranatense*, whose native range is Colombia to northwestern Venezuela and Peru.  

[^f77n9]: The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*), the seeds of which are made into chocolate. The cacao tree is native to Central and South America and has been cultivated by Amerindians for thousands of years. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.

> VER. 441. *sappadillas*\] This is a pleasant-tasted fruit, somewhat resembling a bergamot-pear, in shape and colour. The tree which produces it, is large and shady. Its leaves are of a shining green; but the flowers, which are monopetalous, are of a palish white. The fruit is coronated when ripe, and contains, in its pulp, several longish black seeds. It is wholesome. Antigua[^f78n5] produces the best sappadillas I ever tasted. The trivial name is Spanish. Botanists call it *Cainito*.

[^f78n1]: The sapodilla (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the nasebery or nispero, is a sour or tart fruit whose native range includes Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

[^f78n2]: Sheen is the old name for what is now the London borough of Richmond upon Thames. According to Gilmore, Sheen's royal walks probably refers to Richmond Park, a royal park. 

[^f78n3]: Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811). English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger, best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*. Furthermore, the *Reliques* contains a poem by Grainger entitled "Bryan and Pereene. A West-Indian Ballad," a tragic love story whose theme mirrors that of the story of Junio and Theana. 

[^f78n4]: Greek god of marriage.

[^f78n5]: One of the Leeward Islands; St. Kitts lies just to the west of it. Antigua was colonized by the English in 1632 and now forms part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

[^f79n1]: Educated or learned climes. In addition to describing the practice of Caribbean planters sending their children to Britain for their education, this line refers to the "grand tour," during which individuals would complete their education by visiting mainland Europe's (and especially Italy's) cultural capitals. 

[^f79n2]: France.

[^f80n1]: A name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

[^f80n2]: Gilmore identifies the *Po* as the ship that Grainger traveled on to reach St. Kitts in 1759.

[^f80n3]: An inlet of the Atlantic Ocean to the west of France and the north of Spain; affected by strong currents and storms. 

[^f80n4]: River in southwest France that empties into the Bay of Biscay near Rochefort; the site of an important French naval base.  

[^f80n5]: One of the Madeira Islands in the Atlantic Ocean; the other was Madeira. The Madeiras were a Portuguese colony and an important waystation for transatlantic voyages.

> VER. 504. *The boneta*\] This fish, which is equal in size to the largest salmon, is only to be found in the warm latitudes. It is not a delicate food, but those who have lived for any length of time on salt meats at sea, do not dislike it. Sir Hans Sloane, in his voyage to Jamaica, describes the method of striking them.

> VER. 504. *Or the shark*\] This voracious fish needs no description; I have seen them from 15 to 20 foot long. Some naturalists call it *Canis Carharias*. They have been known to follow a slave-ship from Guinea[^f81n7] to the West Indies.[^f81n8] They swim with incredible celerity, and are found in some of the warmer seas of Europe, as well as between the tropics.

> VER. 507. *winged fishes*\] This extraordinary species of fish is only found in the warm latitudes. Being pursued in the water by a fish of prey called Albacores,[^f81n10] they betake themselves in shoals to flight, and in the air are often snapt up by the Garayio,[^f81n11] a sea fowl. They sometimes fall on the shrouds or decks of ships. They are well tasted, and commonly sold at Barbadoes.[^f81n12]

> VER. 508. *Dolphins*\] This is a most beautiful fish, when first taken out of the sea; but its beauty vanishes, almost as soon as it is dead.

[^f81n1]: The \"Errata\" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "sky" should read "air."  

[^f81n2]: Either end of the yard of a square-rigged ship. The yard is a spar slung across a mast to support and extend a square sail.  

[^f81n3]: Atlantic Bonito (*Sarda sarda*). Fish related to the tuna and mackerel whose range extends from Norway to South Africa in the eastern Atlantic (including the Mediterranean and the Black Sea) and from Nova Scotia to the northern Gulf of Mexico in the western Atlantic.    

[^f81n4]: The nautilus is the Portuguese man-of-war or man o' war (*Physalia physalis*), a highly toxic relative of the jellyfish. It is called the man-of-war for its resemblance to an eighteenth-century warship under full sail. Also, the "Errata" list for *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that lines 505 and 506 should read instead, "The fring'd urtica spreads her purple form/To catch the gale, and dances o'er the waves:".   

[^f81n5]: Flying fish, which are small fish of the *Exocoetidae* family that glide above the water to escape predators. The strongest fish can "fly" nearly 200 meters in one glide.  

[^f81n6]: The dolphin fish, dorado, or mahi-mahi (*Coryphaena hippurus*), which is widespread in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as in the Mediterranean.  

[^f81n7]: A region on the west coast of Africa that served as a center of the Atlantic slave trade. Roughly covered a geographic region that included parts of modern-day Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Not to be confused with the modern nation of Guinea on the western coast of Africa.  

[^f81n8]: Sharks \(clade Selachimorpha\) were notorious for following slave ships across the Atlantic, since slavers threw those individuals who died during the voyage overboard. Slavers also used sharks to terrorize their captives and subdue rebellious behavior. For example, one captain facing the prospect of suicides among his captives decided to lower a woman into the water, where she was bitten in half (Rediker 40).

[^f81n9]: The \"Errata\" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "nautilus" should read "urtica."  

[^f81n10]: Albacore tuna (*Thunnus alalunga*), which is found in tropical and temperate waters of all the oceans, including the Mediterranean. Now a threatened species due to overfishing.  

[^f81n11]: Perhaps the tropic bird (any seabird of the family Phaethontidae) or the frigate bird (any seabird of the family Fregatidae), both of which prey on flying fish.  

[^f81n12]: One of the Lesser Antilles; colonized by the English in 1627. Gained independence in 1966.

> VER. 509. *Tropic-bird*\] The French call this bird Fregate, on account of its swift flying. It is only to be met with in the warm latitudes.

[^f82n1]: Although he uses the term tropic bird, Grainger means the frigate bird, which was famed for its wide wingspan and ability to remain airborne for weeks.  

[^f82n2]: Lightning. 

[^f82n3]: A swift horse, a racer.

- All pale and cold, in every feature death,

ARGUMENT.

*Hymn to the month of January, when crop begins. Address. Planters have employment all the year round. Planters should be pious. A ripe Cane-piece on fire at midnight. Crop begun. Cane cutting described. Effects of music. Great care requisite in feeding the mill. Humanity towards the maimed recommended. The tainted Canes should not be ground. Their use. How to preserve the laths and mill-points from sudden squalls. Address to the Sun, and praise of Antigua. A cattle-mill described. Care of mules, &c. Diseases to which they are subject. A water-mill the least liable to interruption. Common in Guadaloupe and Martinico. Praise of Lord Romney. The necessity of a strong, clear fire, in boiling. Planters should always have a spare set of vessels, because the iron furnaces are apt to crack, and copper vessels to melt. The danger of throwing cold water into a thorough-heated furnace. Cleanliness, and skimming well, recommended. A boiling-house should be lofty, and open at top, to the leeward. Constituent parts of vegetables. Sugar an essential salt. What retards its granulation. How to forward it. Dumb Cane. Effects of it. Bristol-lime the best temper. Various uses of Bristol lime. Good muscovado described. Bermudas-lime recommended. The Negroes should not be hindered from drinking the hot liquor. The chearfulness and healthiness of the Negroes in crop-time. Boilers to be encouraged. They should neither boil the Sugar too little, nor too much. When the Sugar is of too loose a grain, and about to boil over the teache, or last copper, a little grease settles it, and makes it boil closer. The French often mix sand with their Sugars. This practice not followed by the English. A character. Of the skimmings. Their various uses. Of rum. Its praise. A West-India prospect, when crop is finished. An address to the Creoles, to live more upon their estates than they do. The reasons.*

- HAIL, eldest birth of Time![^f88n1] in other climes,
- In the old world, with tempests usher'd in;
- While rifled nature thine appearance wails,
- And savage winter wields his iron mace: [15]
- But not the rockiest verge of these green isles,
- Tho' mountains heapt on mountains brave the sky,
- Dares winter, by his residence, prophane.
- At times the ruffian, wrapt in murky state,
- Inroads will, sly, attempt; but soon the sun, [20]
- Benign protector of the Cane-land isles,
- Repells the invader, and his rude mace breaks.
- Here, every mountain, every winding dell,
- \(Haunt of the Dryads;[^f88n2] where, beneath the shade
- Of broad-leaf'd china,[^f88n3] idly they repose, [25]

> VER. 17. *Tho' mountains heapt on mountains*\] This more particularly alludes to St. Kitts; where one of the highest ridges of that chain of mountains, which run through its center, from one end of it to the other, bears upon it another mountain, which, somewhat resembling the legendary prints of the devil's carrying on his shoulders St. Christopher; or, as others write, of a giant,[^f88n4] of that appellation, carrying our Saviour, in the form of a child, in the same manner, through a deep sea; gave name, to this island.

> VER. 25. *Of broad-leaf'd china,*\] The leaves of this medicinal tree are so large, that the Negroes commonly use them to cover the water, which they bring in pails from the mountain, where it chiefly grows. The roots of this tree were introduced into European practice, soon after the venereal disease; but, unless they are fresh, it must be confessed they possess fewer virtues than either sarsaparilla[^f88n5] or lignum

[^f88n1]: January.

[^f88n2]: Wood or tree nymphs in Greek mythology.  

[^f88n3]: The china-root plant, *Smilax china*, which is valued for its medicinal properties. Its native range extends from China to Japan and the Philippines. Whether *Smilax china* grew in the eighteenth-century Caribbean is unclear. The genus *Smilax* contains approximately 350 species, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Today, the species *Smilax viscifolia* is commonly known as "China root" in Jamaica.  

[^f88n4]: A reference to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means "Christ carrier," once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river.  

[^f88n5]: Refers to various species of the genus *Smilax* native to Central and South America. Spanish conquistadors named it *zarzaparilla* and learned from indigenous peoples to use it as an antisyphilitic. Also used to flavor drinks, including root beer in the nineteenth century. Grainger may have been referring to the species *Smilax regelii*, known as "Jamaica sarsaparilla."

> vitae.[^f89n5] It also grows in China, and many parts of the East-Indies,[^f89n6] where it is greatly recommended in the gout, palsy, sciatica, obstructions,[^f89n7] and obstinate headachs: but it can surely not effect the removal of these terrible disorders; since, in China, the people eat the fresh root, boiled with their meat, as we do turnips; and the better sort, there, use a water distilled from it. The Spaniards call it *Palo de China*. The botanical name is *Smilax*.
 
[^f89n1]: The new year was generally considered crop time, a period of intense activity when cane was harvested, milled, and prepared for export.  

[^f89n2]: Refers to Samuel Martin (1694/5-1776), an Antiguan-born British plantation owner and author of *Essay upon Plantership*, which was first published in Antigua around 1750 and then in several more editions before the end of the eighteenth century. The *Essay* contains Martin's recommendations for plantation management and covers topics ranging from the planting and harvesting of cane to the regulation of enslaved labor. 

[^f89n3]: Bad temper or a melancholy temperament.  

[^f89n4]: Informal education provided by experience in nature or the wilderness, rather than in the classroom.

[^f89n5]: The hard, dense wood of the guaiac tree (*Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean). Lignum vitae ("wood of life") was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. 

[^f89n6]: The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.  

[^f89n7]: Gout is metabolic arthritis, frequently in the joints of the large toe, resulting in painful inflammations caused by deposits of uric acid crystals. Palsy is paralysis of the skeletal muscles. Sciatica is irritation or inflammation of the sciatic nerve. It causes severe pain from the lower back to the legs. Obstructions are blocks in any tubular organ or structure, (i.e., an intestinal bowel blockage, which causes vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain).

- The ripened cane-piece; and, with her, to taste
- \(Delicious draught!\) the nectar of the mill! [45]

- THE planter's labour in a round revolves;[^f90n1]
- Ends with the year, and with the year begins.

- YE swains,[^f90n2] to Heaven bend low in grateful prayer,
- Worship the Almighty; whose kind-fostering hand
- Hath blest your labour, and hath given the cane [50]
- To rise superior to each menac'd ill.

- NOR less, ye planters, in devotion, sue,
- That nor the heavenly bolt, nor casual spark,
- Nor hand of malice may the crop destroy.[^f90n3]

- AH me! what numerous, deafning bells, resound? [55]
- What cries of horror startle the dull sleep?

- Where were ye, watches, when the flame burst forth? [60]
- A little care had then the hydra[^f90n5] quell'd:
- But, now, what clouds of white smoke load the sky!
- How strong, how rapid the combustion pours!

[^f90n1]: Cane cultivation is a year-round affair that nevertheless has distinct rhythms, which arise from the fact that cane can take 15-24 months to mature.  

[^f90n2]: A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. A key figure in georgic poetry.  

[^f90n3]: A reference to arson. Grainger does not specify who the arsonists might be, but this is one of the places where he hints at moments of enslaved resistance on Caribbean plantations.  

[^f90n4]: Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

[^f90n5]: A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The term also signifies a difficult task.

- Aid not, ye winds! with your destroying breath,
- The spreading vengeance.—They contemn my prayer. [65]

- ROUS'D by the deafning bells, the cries, the blaze;
- From every quarter, in tumultuous bands,
- The Negroes rush; and, 'mid the crackling flames,
- Plunge, daemon-like! All, all, urge every nerve:
- This way, tear up those Canes; dash the fire out, [70]
- Which sweeps, with serpent-error, o'er the ground.
- There, hew these down; their topmost branches burn:
- And here bid all thy watery engines play;
- For here the wind the burning deluge drives.

- IN vain.—More wide the blazing torrent rolls;[75]
- More loud it roars, more bright it fires the pole!
- And toward thy mansion, see, it bends its way.
- Haste! far, O far, your infant-throng remove:
- Quick from your stables drag your steeds and mules:
- With well-wet blankets guard your cypress-roofs; [80]
- And where thy dried Canes in large stacks are pil'd.—

- EFFORTS but serve to irritate the flames:
- Naught but thy ruin can their wrath appease.
- Ah, my Palaemon! what avail'd thy care,

> VER. 81. *And where thy dried Canes*\] The Cane-stalks which have been ground, are called *Magoss*; probably a corruption of the French word *Bagasse*,[^f91n1] which signifies the same thing. They make an excellent fewel.

[^f91n1]: Bagasse refers to the crushed sugar cane stalks that are the byproduct of milling cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel to boil cane syrup and as cattle feed.

- Oft to prevent the earliest dawn of day, [85]
- And walk thy ranges, at the noon of night?
- What tho' no ills assail'd thy bunching sprouts,
- And seasons pour'd obedient to thy will:
- All, all must perish; nor shalt thou preserve
- Wherewith to feed thy little orphan-throng. [90]

- OH, may the Cane-isles know few nights, like this!
- For now the sail-clad points,[^f92n1] impatient, wait
- The hour of sweet release, to court the gale.
- The late-hung coppers[^f92n2] wish to feel the warmth,
- Which well-dried fewel from the Cane imparts: [95]
- The Negroe-train, with placid looks, survey
- Thy fields, which full perfection have attain'd,
- And pant to wield the bill: \(no surly watch
- Dare now deprive them of the luscious Cane:\)[^f92n3]
- Nor thou, my friend, their willing ardour check; [100]
- Encourage rather; cheerful toil is light.
- So from no field, shall slow-pac'd oxen draw
- More frequent loaded wanes;[^f92n4] which many a day,
- And many a night shall feed thy crackling mills
- With richest offerings:[^f92n5] while thy far seen flames, [105]
- Bursting thro' many a chimney, bright emblaze
- The AEthiop-brow[^f92n6] of night. And see, they pour

[^f92n1]: Windmill sails.  

[^f92n2]: Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.  

[^f92n3]: In his *An Essay on the More Common West-India Diseases* (1764), Grainger writes that enslaved laborers "should not only be allowed to drink what quantity of the cane juice they think proper, but even obliged to drink it" during crop time (10). However, plantesr sometimes inflicted severe punishments when the enslaved ate or consumed sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thistlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth (Hall 73).  

[^f92n4]: A wane is a large open vehicle or wagon drawn by horses or oxen and used to carry heavy loads, especially of agricultural produce.  

[^f92n5]: Cane juice begins to spoil as soon as the plant is cut. As a result, planters preferred to run their mills and boiling houses 24 hours per day during crop time.  

[^f92n6]: Aethiop and Aethiopia (also Ethiop and Ethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Aethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Aethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.

- \(For not a part of this amazing plant,

- Not laziness declines this easy toil;
- Even lameness from it's leafy pallet crawls,

- Cut into junks[^f93n4] a yard in length, and tied

- The mules crook-harnest, and the sturdier crew,

[^f93n1]: The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.  

[^f93n2]: Sugar cane turns yellow when it is ripe.  

[^f93n3]: Sugar cane buds. To produce new sugar cane, sugar cane stalks with buds on them were planted in the ground.  

[^f93n4]: A gathering of stems or stalks.

- With sweet abundance. As on Lincoln-plains, [130]
- \(Ye plains of Lincoln sound your Dyer's praise!\)[^f94n1]
- When the lav'd snow-white flocks are numerous penn'd;
- The senior swains, with sharpen'd shears, cut off
- The fleecy vestment; others stir the tar;
- And some impress, upon their captives sides, [135]
- Their master's cypher;[^f94n2] while the infant throng
- Strive by the horns to hold the struggling ram,
- Proud of their prowess. Nor meanwhile the jest
- Light-bandied round, but innocent of ill;
- Nor choral song are wanting: eccho rings. [140]

- NOR need the driver, AEthiop authoriz'd,
- Thence more inhuman, crack his horrid whip;
- From such dire sounds the indignant muse averts
- Her virgin-ear,[^f94n3] where musick loves to dwell:
- 'Tis malice now, 'tis wantonness of power [145]
- To lash the laughing, labouring, singing throng.[^f94n4]

- WHAT cannot song? all nature feels its power:
- The hind's[^f94n5] blithe whistle, as thro' stubborn soils
- He drives the shining share; more than the goad,
- His tardy steers impells.—The muse hath seen, [150]

[^f94n1]: John Dyer (1699-1757), Welsh painter and poet, author of the georgic poem *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Lincoln was a center of wool production, and the Lincoln longwool is a breed of sheep known for its copious and heavy white fleece.  

[^f94n2]: The practice of branding sheep. Although he does not make an explicit comparison between the treatment of animals and human beings, this passage recalls the fact that enslaved persons were branded with the marks of their enslavers. See Gilmore, who credits Tobias Döring with this insight.  

[^f94n3]: This is one of several places in the poem where Grainger shrinks from the violence of plantation slavery.  

[^f94n4]: Grainger refers here to the common practice of enslaved laborers singing while working in the cane fields. The songs were sung in part to help establish a rhythm and pace for the work being performed, and planters also saw them as helping to lighten the burden of the labor being performed. In short, they saw music and singing as making work more pleasant and thereby ensuring compliance with the regime of plantation discipline. At the same time, the songs sung during field work often seem to have contained coded or even overt criticisms of planters and plantation discipline. For example, the Gloucestershire Archives in Britain recently uncovered an eighteenth-century slave song from Barbados that contained the lyrics, "Massa buy me he won't killa me/Oh_ Massa buy me he won't killa me/Oh Massa buy me he won't kill a me/Oh 'for he kill me he ship me regular" (see "Song of slaves in Barbados" at https://gloucestershire.gov.uk/archives/learning-for-all/online-exhibitions/inhuman-traffic/). A recording of the song by the Christ Faith Tabernacle of Gloucester also highlights the song's minor key, which imbues it with a sorrowful and tragic dimension (see https://gloucestershire.gov.uk/media/2126/song_48_1mp3-15777.mp3).  

[^f94n5]: A hind is a farm servant or agricultural laborer.

- When health danc'd frolic in her youthful veins,
- And vacant gambols wing'd the laughing hours;
- The muse hath seen on Annan's[^f95n1] pastoral hills,
- Of theft and slaughter erst the fell retreat,
- But now the shepherd's best-beloved walk: [155]
- Hath seen the shepherd, with his sylvan pipe,
- Lead on his flock o'er crags, thro' bogs, and streams,
- A tedious journey; yet not weary they,
- Drawn by the enchantment of his artless song.
- What cannot musick?—When brown Ceres[^f95n2] asks [160]
- The reapers sickle; what like magic sound,
- Puff'd from sonorous bellows[^f95n3] by the squeeze
- Of tuneful artist, can the rage disarm
- Of the swart dog-star,[^f95n4] and make harvest light?

- AND now thy mills dance eager in the gale; [165]
- Feed well their eagerness: but O beware;
- Nor trust, between the steel-cas'd cylinders,[^f95n5]
- The hand incautious: off the member snapt[^f95n6]
- Thou'lt ever rue; sad spectacle of woe!

> VER. 168. *Off the member snapt*\] This accident will sometimes happen, especially in the night: and the unfortunate wretch must fall a victim to his imprudence or sleepiness, if a hatchet do not immediately strike off the entangled member; or the mill be not instantly put out of the wind.[^f95n7]

[^f95n1]: The Annan is a river in Dumfries and Galloway, a unitary council area in southern Scotland near the border with England. During the 1332 Battle of Annan at the outset of the Second War of Scottish Independence (1332-1357), Sir Archibald Douglas attacked Edward Balliol and his army at Annan. Escaping just before being captured, Balliol is said to have fled naked to England.  

[^f95n2]: Italo-Roman goddess of growth and agriculture.  

[^f95n3]: Bagpipes.  

[^f95n4]: The dog star is another name for Sirius, brightest star in the constellation Canis Major. Sirius rises in conjunction with the sun from July 3 to August 11, which are known as the "dog days" of summer.  

[^f95n5]: Grinders in sugar mills tended to be vertical cylinders that crushed cane stalks as they were turned.  

[^f95n6]: Milling cane was a dangerous activity, and it was not uncommon for enslaved millers to catch body parts between the rollers. Whether mills were powered by wind, water, or muscle, it was unlikely that the rollers could be stopped instantaneously. Instead, planters were encouraged to supply their mills with axes so that injured limbs could be amputated without delay.  

[^f95n7]: To put a windmill "out of the wind" is to stop the mill by turning the sails so they no longer catch the wind.

- ARE there, the muse can scarce believe the tale; [170]
- Are there, who lost to every feeling sense,

- Maim'd by imprudence, or the hand of Heaven?
- The good man feeds his blind, his aged steed, [175]
- That in his service spent his vigorous prime:
- And dares a mortal to his fellow man,

- Deny protection? Muse suppress the tale.

- YE! who in bundles bind the lopt-off Canes; [180]
- But chiefly ye! who feed the tight-brac'd mill;

> Pere Labat[^f96n2] says, he was informed the English were wont, as a punishment, thus to grind their negroes to death. But one may venture to affirm this punishment never had the sanction of law; and if any Englishman ever did grind his negroes to death, I will take upon me to aver, he was universally detested by his countrymen.  

> Indeed the bare suspicion of such a piece of barbarity leaves a stain: and therefore authors cannot be too cautious of admitting into their writings, any insinuation that bears hard on the humanity of a people.  

> Daily observation affords but too many proofs, where domestic slavery does not obtain, of the fatal consequences of indulged passion and revenge; but where one man is the absolute property of another, those passions may perhaps receive additional activity: planters, therefore, cannot be too much on their guard against the first sallies of passion; as by indulgence, passion, like a favourite, will at last grow independently powerful.

[^f96n1]: To free from slavery. Here, Grainger criticizes planters who manumit the enslaved who are too old or too injured to work. Implicit in this criticism is that such manumitted persons, though free, were abandoned to care for themselves.

[^f96n2]: Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), Dominican missionary who worked in Guadeloupe for several years and authored the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

It was long uninhabited on account of its wanting fresh-water rivers; but is now more fully peopled, and as well cultivated as any of the leeward islands. In a seasonable year, it has made 30,000 hogsheads[^f98n5] of sugar. It has no very high mountains. The soil is, in general, clayey. The water of the body-ponds[^f98n6] may be used for every purpose of life. Antigua is well fortified, and has a good militia.

[^f98n1]: The coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*), which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia.

[^f100n4]: Much of the plumbing involved in sugar production and distillation was made of (or lined with) lead. A common side effect of excessive rum consumption in the eighteenth century was lead poisoning, which often manifested in severe stomach aches (dry gripes or colic).  

[^f100n5]: Freed from impurities, cleansed. 

[^f100n6]: A dark brown, unrefined sugar that was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. Often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Britain and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.

[^f100n8]: Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) was an English courtier during Queen Elizabeth I's reign, as well as an explorer and author who obtained a patent for and helped to organize the expeditions to Roanoke in 1585 and 1587. He set out for South America in 1595, exploring the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela, and again in 1617 to search for the famed city of El Dorado. He was executed for treason in 1618. Raleigh is the author of *Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana* (1596) and is associated with the introduction of tobacco to England. 

[^f100n9]: Sebastian Cabot (c. 1481/2-1557) was a Venetian navigator and cartographer who explored the North Atlantic and traveled down the northeastern coast of North America, perhaps as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in 1508-1509. Also led an expedition in 1526 that was supposed to reach Asia but went no further than Brazil. Cabot's place of birth is unclear. Although generally acknowledged as Venice, it might also have been Bristol (late in life, Cabot himself claimed to have been born in Bristol).

Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh a patent for all such land, from 33. to 40. N. lat. as he should chuse to settle with English, reserving only to the crown a fifth part of all the gold and silver which should therein be discovered, in lieu of all services. Accordingly several imbarkations were fitted out from England, but all to no purpose. Some farther attempts, however, were made to settle this part of the country in the succeeding reign; but it was not till the year 1620, that a regular form of government took place. Then was tobacco planted, and negroes imported into Virginia. Since that time it has gradually improved, and does not now contain fewer than 100,000 white people of better condition, besides twice as many servants and slaves.

[^f104n1]: Working conditions in the boiling house were extremely difficult, and only the strongest of the enslaved were assigned there. Tasks included stoking the fires to boil the sugarcane juice and skimming or removing the impurities that rose to the top. Being a boiler was more than merely physical work, however: it also required considerable technical and practical knowledge about the process of sugar production and refinement, and enslavers depended heavily on their head refiners or boilers for good yields of sugar from their crops.

> VER. 350. *For taste, for colour, and for various use:*\] It were impossible, in the short limits of a note, to enumerate the various uses of Sugar; and, indeed, as these are in general so well known, it is needless. A few properties of it, however, wherewith the learned are not commonly acquainted, I shall mention. In some places of the East-Indies, an excellent arrack[^f106n2] is made from the Sugar-Cane: And, in South-America, Sugar is used as an antidote against one of the most sudden, as well as fatal poisons in the world. Taken by mouth, *pocula morte carent*, this poison is quite innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood of the body immediately to the heart, it forthwith bursts it.[^f106n3] The fish and birds killed by these poisoned arrows \(in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert\) are perfectly wholesome to feed on. See Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon.[^f106n4] It is a vegetable preparation.

> VER. 357. *That Cane*\] This, by the natives, is emphatically called the *Dumb Cane*;[^f106n5] for a small quantity of its juice being rubbed on the brim of a drinking vessel, whoever drinks out of it, soon after will have his lips and tongue enormously swelled. A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time, recommends it both by the mouth and externally, in dropsical and other cases:[^f106n6] But I cannot say, I have had any experience of its efficacy in these disorders. It grows wild in the mountains; and, by its use in Sugar-making, should seem to be somewhat of an alcalescent[^f106n7] nature. It grows to four feet high, having, at the top, two green shining leaves, about nine inches long; and, between these, a small spire emerges.

[^f106n1]: Acidic or sour substance.

[^f106n2]: An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).

[^f106n3]: The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.

[^f106n4]: Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).  

[^f106n5]: *Dieffenbachia seguine*. The dumb cane looks very similar to sugar cane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugar cane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours. Its native range is the Caribbean and tropical South America.  

[^f106n6]: Grainger is referring to Thomas Trapham, author of *A Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica* (1679). 

[^f106n7]: Also alkalescent. Tending to become alkaline (having a pH greater than 7).

[^f107n3]: Limestone is a rock that yields lime when calcined or burnt. Lime was used in Grainger's time to refine sugar: when boiled with sugar, lime precipitated impurities.

[^f107n4]: Bristol was located in the southwest of England and was one of England's most important sugar-refining cities in the eighteenth century. Although the initial steps of sugar production happened in the Caribbean, sugar was further refined in Britain before being sold to consumers there. Bristol became a center for sugar refining in part because it had ample supplies of limestone. 

[^f107n5]: A line from William Whitehead's poem, "An Hymn to the Nymph of Bristol Spring" (1751). 

[^f107n6]: Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process.

> VER. 428. *If too soon they strike,*\] When the Cane-juice is granulated sufficiently, which is known by the Sugar's sticking to the ladle, and roping like a syrup, but breaking off from its edges; it is poured into a cooler, where, its surface being smoothed, the christallization is soon completed. This is called *striking*. The general precept is to temper high, and strike low. When the Muscovado is of a proper consistence, it is dug out of the cooler, and put into hogsheads; this is called *potting*. The casks being placed upon staunchions, the melasses[^f110n3] drips from them into a cistern, made on purpose, below them, to receive it. The Sugar is sufficiently cured, when the hogshead rings upon being struck with a stick; and when the two canes, which are put into every cask, shew no melasses upon them, when drawn out of it.

[^f114n1]: The theme of pleasurable labor is central to the georgic. Here, Grainger's narrator experiences labor as pleasurable after he has drunk rum, which is an end product of enslaved labor.

[^f114n2]: The Marne is a French tributary of the Seine that flows through the Champagne region in northeastern France. Wines have been made there since the Roman era, but most champagnes were still wines until the mid-nineteenth century, when sparkling wines became popular. The Tille is a river in Burgundy, a major wine-producing region in France.

[^f114n3]: Vigornian is the Latin name for Worcester, a center of cider production in England.

[^f114n4]: Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit.

[^f114n5]: State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.

[^f114n6]: Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

[^f114n7]: In this line, Grainger lists literary figures he knew from his time in London. Johnson is Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. His works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade. For Johnson's rebuke, see the note for lines 72-118 in Book IV (the lines that Johnson objected to). Percy is Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811), an English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger, he is best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*. The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated 9 May 1801, written to Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes' *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811 (Anderson 9.59, 9.67-68, 9.269).  

[^f114n8]: Charlotte Lennox (1730/1731?-1804), British writer best known for the novel *The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella* (1752). A close friend of Samuel Johnson.

[^f114n9]: Calpe refers to one of the Pillars of Hercules in Greek mythology, now known as the Rock of Gibraltar. 

[^f114n10]: Paeon is the Greek god of healing, also known as Paean. By Paeon's son, Grainger is referring to himself.

> VER. 522. *sand-box*\] So called, from the pericarpium's being often made use of for containing sand; when the seeds, which are a violent emetic,[^f115n5] are taken out. This is a fine shady tree, especially when young; and its leaves are efficaciously applied in headachs to the temples, which they sweat. It grows fast; but loses much of its beauty by age. Its wood is brittle, and when cut emits a milky juice, which is not caustic. The sand-box thrives best in warm shady places. The sun often splits the pericarpium, which then cracks like a pistol. It is round, flatted both above and below, and divided into a great number of regular compartments, each of which contains one seed flatted ovularly. The botanical name is *Hura*.

[^f115n1]: Unskilled or unrefined poetry.

[^f115n2]: The sandbox tree (*Hura crepitans*) gets its name from its seed pods, which, when dried, were used as sandboxes for blotting ink. Apart from being quite tall, the sandbox tree is peculiar for two other reasons: its leaves, bark, and sap are poisonous, and, when ripe, its seed pods open with loud, explosive sounds, flinging their seeds at speeds exceeding 100 mph. Its native range is the tropical Americas. 

[^f115n3]: Dwellings of enslaved Africans.

[^f115n4]: Plantains and bananas (family Musaceae) are closely related. Both also formed a part of the diets of the enslaved, but plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Grainger's description of plantain and banana trees growing around "reed-built huts" probably is meant to evoke the provision grounds and gardens that the enslaved often cultivated to provide for their daily subsistence. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. They subsequently were introduced to the Caribbean by the Spanish (Higman 134).  

[^f115n5]: A medicine that excites vomiting.

> VER. 549. *papaws*\] This singular tree, whose fruits surround its summit immediately under the branches and leaves, like a necklace; grows quicker than almost any other in the West Indies. The wood is of no use, being spungy, hollow, and herbacious; however, the blossoms and fruit make excellent sweet-meats;[^f116n2] but above all, the juice of the fruit being rubbed upon a spit, will intenerate[^f116n3] new killed fowls, *&c*. a circumstance of great consequence in a climate, where the warmth soon renders whatever meats are attempted to be made tender by keeping, unfit for culinary purposes. Nor, will it only intenerate fresh meat; but, being boiled with salted beef, will render it easily digestible. Its milky juice is sometimes used to cure ringworms.[^f116n4] It

[^f116n1]: Tamarind refers to the tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*), which is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp is used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes. According to Gilmore, the panspan or hog plum is *Spondias mombin*. Its native range is Mexico to the tropical Americas. The pawpaw is better known as the papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its native range is southern Mexico to Venezuela. 

[^f116n2]: Preserved or candied fruits. 

[^f116n3]: To make tender, soften. 

[^f116n4]: Ringworm, or *tinea*, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.

[^f117n1]: In Greco-Roman mythology, Iris was the daughter of the Titan Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra and sometimes cited as the wife of Zephyrus, the west wind. Her name in Greek means rainbow. The goddess Juno took her to serve as her handmaid. 

[^f117n2]: "Hesperian throats" refers to the Hesperides, the daughters of Night and Erebus who guarded the tree of golden apples given by Hera to earth. They also were renowned for their singing. Because the tree was popularly located beyond the Atlas mountains at the western border of the Ocean, Hesperian can mean western. When referring to a specific geographic location, it designates Italy or Spain.

[^f117n3]: Of the spring.

[^f117n4]: Larks are any of several small birds of the family Alaudidae. Renowned for their singing and mostly found in the Old World, larks are also conventionally associated with the dawn.

[^f118n1]: By the time Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane*, there was a long-standing tradition in European literature of using insects to represent moral, religious, and philosophical ideas.  

[^f118n2]: May refer to the Zenaida dove (*Zenaida aurita*), a bird native to the Caribbean.

[^f118n3]: Grainger refers here either to the common practice of absentee plantership, in which plantation owners lived in Britain and managed their plantations from afar, or to the equally common practice of sending children of planters to Britain for education.  

[^f118n4]: Metropolitan British attitudes toward creoles was inevitably condescending, regardless of how wealthy planters were. Grainger himself looked down upon creoles when he lived in St. Kitts. Writing to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy on 5 June 1762, Grainger noted that "reading, I assure you, is the least part of a Creole's consideration. It is even happy if they can read at all; Spell few of them can; and when they take up a book, modern romance, magazines or newspapers are the extent of their lucubrations" (Nichols 278).

[^f118n5]: Bellona, the Roman goddess of war. Once again, Grainger is referencing the Seven Years' War.

[^f118n6]: A one-handed snare drum often played as a military instrument.

The Jew-fish is often met with at Antigua, which enjoys the happiness of having on its coast few, if any, poisoned fishes.

[^f119n1]: George Townshend, first Marquess Townshend (1724-1807), an English politician and caricaturist who also had a distinguished military career, serving as second in command to Major-General James Wolfe in Canada during the Seven Years' War and then as overall commander after Wolfe's death during the campaign to take French-held Quebec, which surrendered to British forces in 1759.

> VER. 613. *Barbuda*,] This is a low, and not large stock-island, belonging to the Codrington family. Part of this island, as also two plantations in Barbadoes, were left by Colonel Christopher Codrington, for building a college in Barbardoes, and converting Negroes to the Christian religion.[^f120n10]

> VER. 614. *Anguilla*,] This island is about thirty miles long and ten broad. Though not mountainous, it is rocky, and abounds with strong passes; so that a few of its inhabitants, who are indeed expert in the use of fire-arms, repulsed, with great slaughter, a considerable detachment of French, who made a descent thereon in the war preceding the last.[^f120n11] Cotton and cattle are its chief commodities. Many of the inhabitants are rich; the captain-general of the Leeward-Islands nominates the governor and council. They have no assembly.

[^f120n1]: One of several species of terrestrial or land crabs, the black land crab (*Gecarcinus ruricola*) lives in damp and shaded forest areas inland and migrates in large numbers to the sea to breed. It is one of the most commonly exploited land crabs for human consumption in the Caribbean. Eighteenth-century observers were often fascinated by the mass migration of land crabs. 

[^f120n2]: Cambria is the Latin name for Wales.

[^f120n3]: Scotia is the Latin name for Scotland.

[^f120n4]: Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeastern tropical Africa.

[^f120n5]: A small island near Antigua and now part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

[^f120n6]: Anguilla, the most northerly of the Leeward Islands.

[^f120n7]: Lusitania \(now modern Portugal\) was an ancient region of western Iberia inhabited by the Lusitani but also by other peoples, including Celtic tribes. 

[^f120n8]: A major river that flows through Germany. Rieslings are the best-known Rhenish wines.

[^f120n9]: Refers to the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), a series of wars that eventually enveloped most of continental Europe and included the Franco-Hapsburg War (1635-1648), which was fought in part along the Rhine. 

[^f120n10]: Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born in Barbados and belonged to the wealthy Codrington family, which owned sugar plantations in Antigua and Barbados and leased land in Barbuda. Codrington served as deputy-governor of Barbados and governor-general of the Leeward Islands. At his death in 1710, he bequeathed his Barbados plantations and a share of the island of Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), an Anglican missionary organization that aimed to convert colonial inhabitants, including enslaved and free Africans, to Christianity. In 1745, the SPG opened Codrington College, which initially served only white colonists. 

[^f120n11]: The War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748), during which a French force unsuccessfully tried to invade Anguilla in 1745.

- Leave Europe; there, through all her coyest ways, [625]
- Her secret mazes, nature is pursued:
- But here, with savage loneliness, she reigns

- Affrighted, on the labouring main below.
- Heavens! what stupendous, what unnumbered trees, [630]
- "Stage above stage, in various verdure drest,"
- Unprofitable shag its airy cliffs!
- Heavens! what new shrubs, what herbs with useless bloom,

- There let philosphy conduct thy steps,
- "For naught is useless made:"[^f121n1] With candid search,
- Examine all the properties of things;

- The midnight-hour, shall hear my constant vows [645]
- To Nature; see me prostrate at her shrine!
- And, O, if haply I may aught invent

[^f121n1]: Gilmore identifies John Philips's *Cyder* as the source of this quotation. In these final lines of Book III, Grainger compares the Caribbean to Europe and enjoins scientists and natural philosophers to explore and learn about the New World's vast natural resources. As he does in his preface to the poem, he suggests that the pursuit of knowledge is a good in its own right and ought to take precedence over the more mundane pursuit of wealth.

ARGUMENT.

*Invocation to the Genius of Africa. Address. Negroes when bought should be young, and strong. The Congo-negroes are fitter for the house and trades, than for the field. The Gold-Coast, but especially the Papaw-negroes, make the best field-negroes: but even these, if advanced in years, should not be purchased. The marks of a sound negroe at a negroe sale. Where the men do nothing but hunt, fish or fight, and all field drudgery is left to the women; these are to be preferred to their husbands. The Minnahs make good tradesmen, but addicted to suicide. The Mundingos, in particular, subject to worms; and the Congas, to dropsical disorders. How salt-water, or new negroes should be seasoned. Some negroes eat dirt. Negroes should be habituated by gentle degrees to field labour. This labour, when compared to that in lead-mines, or of those who work in the gold and silver mines of South America, is not only less toilsome, but far more healthy. Negroes should always be treated with humanity. Praise of freedom. Of the dracunculus, or dragon-worm. Of chigres. Of the yaws. Might not this disease be imparted by inoculation? Of worms, and their multiform appearance. Praise of commerce. Of the imaginary disorders of negroes, especially those caused by their conjurers or Obia-men. The composition and supposed virtues of a magic-phiol. Field-negroes should not begin to work before six in the morning, and should leave off between eleven and twelve; and beginning again at two, should finish before sunset. Of the weekly allowance of negroes. The young, the old, the sickly, and even the lazy, must have their victuals prepared for them. Of negroe-ground, and its various productions. To be fenced in, and watched. Of an American garden. Of the situation of the negroe-huts. How best defended from fire. The great negroe-dance described. Drumming, and intoxicating spirits not to be allowed. Negroes should be made to marry in their masters plantation. Inconveniences arising from the contrary practice. Negroes to be cloathed once a year, and before Christmas. Praise of Lewis XIV. for the Code Noir. A body of laws of this kind recommended to the English sugar colonies. Praise of the river Thames. A moon-light landscape and vision.*

THE 

S U G A R - C A N E.

BOOK IV.

- GENIUS of Africk![^f125n1] whether thou bestrid'st
- The castled elephant;[^f125n2] or at the source,
- (While howls the desart fearfully around,\)
- Of thine own Niger,[^f125n3] sadly thou reclin'st
- Thy temples shaded by the tremulous palm, [5]
- Or quick papaw,[^f125n4] whose top is necklac'd round
- With numerous rows of party-colour'd fruit:
- Or hear'st thou rather from the rocky banks
- Of Rio Grandê,[^f125n5] or black Sanaga?[^f125n6]
- Where dauntless thou the headlong torrent brav'st [10]
- In search of gold, to brede[^f125n7] thy wooly locks,
- Or with bright ringlets ornament thine ears,

[^f125n1]: Grainger is using genius in the sense of a supernatural being or guardian spirit associated with a place, institution, or thing. "Genius of Africk" thus means something like the spirit of Africa.

[^f125n2]: The combination of an elephant and a castle (often with the castle on the elephant's back) is an old heraldic sign. Grainger may be calling on the image of Hannibal's elephants during the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE).

[^f125n3]: The Niger river. One of Africa's largest rivers. Its source lies in modern Guinea, and it empties into the Atlantic Ocean in Nigeria.

[^f125n4]: Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its native range is southern Mexico to Venezuela.

[^f125n5]: Major estuary in modern Guinea-Bissau.

[^f125n6]: Most likely the Senegal river, which empties into the Atlantic ocean at St. Louis on Senegal's northern border with Mauritania. There is a Sanaga river that empties into the Gulf of Guinea just south of Douala in modern Cameroon, but this appears to have been called the Cameroon or Camarones river prior to the mid-nineteenth century.

[^f125n7]: Braid.

- Thine arms, and ankles: O attend my song.
- A muse that pities thy distressful state;[^f126n1] 
- Who sees, with grief, thy sons in fetters bound; [15]
- Who wishes freedom to the race of man;[^f126n2]
- Thy nod assenting craves: dread Genius, come!

- YET vain thy presence, vain thy favouring nod;
- Unless once more the muses, that erewhile
- Upheld me fainting in my past career, [20]
- Through Caribbe's[^f126n3] cane-isles; kind condescend
- To guide my footsteps, through parch'd Libya's wilds;[^f126n4]
- And bind my sun-burnt brow with other bays,[^f126n5]
- Than ever deck'd the Sylvan bard[^f126n6] before.

- SAY, will my Melvil,[^f126n7] from the public care, [25]
- Withdraw one moment, to the muses shrine?
- Who smit with thy fair fame, industrious cull
- An Indian wreath[^f126n8] to mingle with thy bays,
- And deck the hero, and the scholar's brow!
- Wilt thou, whose mildness smooths the face of war, [30]
- Who round the victor-blade the myrtle[^f126n9] twin'st,
- And mak'st subjection loyal and sincere;
- O wilt thou gracious hear the unartful strain,
- Whose mild instructions teach, no trivial theme,


[^f126n1]: Despite the fact that *The Sugar-Cane* is unequivocally pro-slavery, Grainger affects a tone of regret and sympathy for the enslaved in these opening lines of Book IV.  

[^f126n2]: By invoking a singular "race of man," Grainger seems to promote the theory of monogenesis. Supporters of monogenesis believed, in keeping with the creation story of Genesis, that all human beings had descended from a common ancestor. According to the alternate theory of polygenesis, different races represented different species, each descended from different ancestors. In the eighteenth century, the concept of polygenesis was often used to argue for the relative superiority and inferiority of races, and to support slavery.  

[^f126n3]: Caribbe's. The Caribbean's.  

[^f126n4]: Not the modern nation of Libya but the Libyan desert in the eastern Sahara. Grainger uses "Lybia" and "Lybians" several times in Book IV of *The Sugar-Cane* to signify Africa and Africans.

[^f126n5]: Laurel \(bay leaf\) crown, often associated with poetic achievement.

[^f126n6]: By Sylvan bard, Grainger literally means poet from the wilderness. Grainger seems to be referring to himself insofar as he was writing from the Caribbean rather than from metropolitan London.

[^f126n7]: Robert Melville (1723-1809), Scottish army officer and colonial governor. Like Grainger, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the British army and fighting in the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748). During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), he fought in the Caribbean, becoming temporary governor of Guadeloupe after defeating the French and then governor of Grenada, Tobago, Dominica, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines in 1764. He was also the founder of the St. Vincent botanic garden, which became a major scientific research station later in the eighteenth century.

[^f126n8]: Grainger's invocation of an Indian wreath further makes the point that the poem is a product of the Caribbean.

[^f126n9]: Myrtle \(*Myrtus communis*\) is an aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love.

- What care the jetty African requires?[^f127n1] [35]
- Yes, thou wilt deign to hear; a man thou art

- The negroes differ: muse that difference sing.[^f127n2]

- WHETHER to wield the hoe, or guide the plane; [40]

[^f127n1]: Jetty means jet black. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century British writers often used the terms "jetty" or "jet" when describing what they saw as the idealized beauty of exceptional Africans. See, for example, Aphra Behn's *Oroonoko: Or, the Royal Slave* (1688), where the narrator describes Oroonoko as having skin of "perfect Ebony, or polish'd Jett" (Behn 13).  

[^f127n2]: Grainger indicates that he is going to distinguish Africans by what he considers to be their different mental abilities and aptitudes for work. As such, he is taking on the perspective of the slave trader and/or buyer, who made judgments about Africans based on similar considerations.  

[^f127n3]: Kingdom in southwest Africa north of Angola and near the modern Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

[^f127n4]: Zaire or Congo river. The second longest river in Africa, it drains into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of the DRC.

[^f127n5]: Grainger recommends that enslaved persons from the Congo be assigned specific trades rather than being forced to work as field laborers.  

[^f127n6]: Malleable, flexible.

- Thy chief attention; and the ambrosial cane [55]
- Thou long'st to see, with spiry frequence, shade
- Many an acre: planter, chuse the slave,
- Who sails from barren climes; where art[^f128n1] alone,
- Offspring of rude necessity, compells
- The sturdy native, or to plant the soil, [60]
- Or stem vast rivers for his daily food.

- SUCH are the children of the Golden Coast;[^f128n2]
- Such the Papaws,[^f128n3] of negroes far the best:
- And such the numerous tribes, that skirt the shore,
- From rapid Volta to the distant Rey.[^f128n4] [65]

- BUT, planter, from what coast soe'er they sail,
- Buy not the old: they ever sullen prove;
- With heart-felt anguish, they lament their home;
- They will not, cannot work; they never learn
- Thy native language; they are prone to ails; [70]
- And oft by suicide their being end.—[^f128n5]

- MUST thou from Africk reinforce thy gang?—[^f128n6]
- Let health and youth their every sinew firm;
- Clear roll their ample eye; their tongue be red;
- Broad swell their chest; their shoulders wide expand; [75]

[^f128n1]: The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "art" should read "want." 

[^f128n2]: Term used by Europeans to define one of the four major trading region on the West African coast. Although it is difficult to establish the borders of these regions with exactitude, they included the Grain Coast (roughly corresponding to modern Sierra Leone and Liberia), the Ivory Coast (modern Côte d'Ivoire), the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and the Slave Coast (modern Togo, Benin, and Nigeria). British slaving ships often made port on the Cape Verde islands off the coast of modern Senegal before sailing down the coast of Africa, trading goods along the way. Once they had rounded the Bight of Benin, they turned west and followed the equator past the island of Saint Thomas (São Tomé) and toward the Caribbean. It is important to note that people were enslaved and embarked from a much larger region than the region denominated by the Slave Coast (the region of embarkation ranged from at least Senegal to Angola).

[^f128n3]: Papaws or Popos. Name of people from the region between Accra in modern Ghana and Ouidah in Benin.

[^f128n4]: The Volta is the Volta river in Ghana, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Accra. The Rey is likely the Rey (or Rio del Rey) estuary in modern Cameroon. It is not clear whether Grainger means a specific river within this estuarial system.

[^f128n5]: Suicide was prevalent in the Atlantic slave trade and occurred during various stages of the process of transportation. Europeans proposed various theories to explain these suicides. In particular, physicians like Grainger often suggested that suicide by the enslaved was caused by physical illness or by a disease known as fixed melancholy. European Christians considered suicide to be a sin (it was a breach of the sixth commandment forbidding murder), but their concern when it came to the enslaved was almost solely economic, as Grainger suggests in these and later lines.  

[^f128n6]: Gang was the general term used to designate groups of enslaved persons.

- Not prominent their belly; clean and strong
- Their thighs and legs, in just proportion rise.[^f129n1]
- Such soon will brave the fervours of the clime;
- And free from ails, that kill thy negroe-train,
- A useful servitude will long support. [80]

- YET, if thine own, thy childrens life, be dear;
- Buy not a Cormantee,[^f129n2] tho' healthy, young.
- Of breed too generous for the servile field;
- They, born to freedom in their native land,
- Chuse death before dishonourable bonds: [85]
- Or, fir'd with vengeance, at the midnight hour,
- Sudden they seize thine unsuspecting watch,
- And thine own poinard[^f129n3] bury in thy breast.

- AT home, the men, in many a sylvan realm, 
- Their rank tobacco, charm of sauntering minds, [90]
- From clayey tubes inhale;[^f129n4] or, vacant, beat
- For prey the forest; or, in war's dread ranks,
- Their country's foes affront: while, in the field,
- Their wives plant rice, or yams, or lofty maize,[^f129n5]
- Fell hunger to repel. Be these thy choice: [95]
- They, hardy, with the labours of the Cane

[^f129n1]: Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), an acquaintance of Grainger and one of the most important writers of the eighteenth century, referred to this and the preceding lines in a review of *The Sugar-Cane* that he published in the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). While the review was largely positive, Johnson took issue with the fact that, here and in the stanzas that follow, Grainger is giving "instructions for the buying and choice" of the enslaved. As he further comments, "here we think that tenderness and humanity, with which the former part of the poem seems replete, is, in some measure, forgotten. The poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation; but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for chusing an horse" (276-277). 

[^f129n2]: Cormantee or Coromantin. Name given to Fanti people embarked at Fort Kormantse in the modern nation of Ghana. By the mid-eighteenth century, the name Cormantee was closely associated with warlike people who resisted enslavement, thus explaining Grainger's warning in these lines. Indeed, Grainger would have been familiar with Tacky's Revolt, a 1760 uprising led by Coromantins in Jamaica. The uprising, which occurred less than a year after Grainger arrived in St. Kitts, loomed large over the remainder of the century and led to a number of increasingly repressive laws. For more information about Tacky's Revolt, see http://revolt.axismaps.com/.  

[^f129n3]: Dagger. 

[^f129n4]: Grainger is describing Africans smoking tobacco out of pipes. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*) is native to the Americas and was introduced to Africa in the 1500s.

[^f129n5]: Rice, yams, and maize were three major food crops in West Africa. While rice (*Oryza glaberrima*) and yams (one of many species of tuber within the *Dioscorea* genus) were native to the region, maize or corn (*Zea mays*) was not: maize's native range is Mexico and Guatemala. Maize was, however, introduced to Africa around 1500. Grainger could also be referring to Guinea corn (*Sorghum bicolor*), an important staple crop first cultivated in Africa thousands of years ago (Higman 222-232).

- Soon grow familiar; while unusual toil,
- And new severities their husbands kill.

- THE slaves from Minnah[^f130n1] are of stubborn breed:

- They soon perfection reach. But fly, with care,

- Whether at home or in these ocean-isles: [115]
- And tho' nice art the water may subdue,

[^f130n1]: Elmina, a city on modern Ghana's Atlantic coast. It was the first European settlement in West Africa and a major stop on the routes of the Atlantic slave trade.  

[^f130n2]: The Moco nation refers to people from the region between Bonny Island and Calabar on the southeastern coast of modern Nigeria. On some historical maps, the Moco nation appears in the same region as the Igbo or Ebo people. The reference to suicide in this line ("they themselves destroy") matches a well-worn steroetype that the Igbo were especially liable to taking their lives.

[^f130n3]: Grainger is referring to parasitic worms (helminths) that live in the digestive tracts of human beings and other animals. There are many such parasites, including tapeworms and roundworms. Worms were a major health concern in the eighteenth century, producing such physical effects as malnutrition and anemia, as well as cognitive problems.

[^f130n4]: The Mundingo, Mandingo, or Mandinka were people of the West African interior centering around the modern nation of Mali but also coming from Senegal, Guinea, and Côte D'Ivoire. With respect to religion, the Mandinka are most closely associated with Islam.  

[^f130n5]: Physician. 

[^f130n6]: Phoebus is an alternate name for the Greek god Apollo and used in contexts where Apollo is identified with the sun. 

[^f130n7]: Part of the Greek underworld reserved for heroes.

[^f130n8]: Cuanzo \(or Kwanza\) river in modern Angola. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean south of Luanda (known in the eighteenth century as Loango or Loando). This line refers to enslaved people from Angola, who were primarily enslaved by the Portuguese.

> VER. 137. *cherries,*\] The tree which produces this wholesome fruit is tall, shady, and of quick growth. Its Indian name is *Acajou*; hence corruptly called *Cashew* by 

[^f131n1]: Ethiop and Ethiopia (also Aethiop and Aethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Ethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Ethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.

[^f131n2]: In Greek mythology, a physician and the son of Asclepius, the god of healing. 

[^f131n3]: Vervain \(*Verbena officinalis*\) is an herbal shrub whose native range is the Old World and Australia. The dried plant is used to make tea. Sempre-vive refers to the genus *Sempervivum* ("always living"), a group of plants native to Europe and parts of Asia. Gilmore notes that Grainger may not have been referring to European vervain but to *Aloe vera*, a plant highly valued for its medicinal properties and native to the Arabian Peninsula.  

[^f131n4]: Calomel or mercuric chloride. Medicine widely used in the eighteenth century for its laxative and purgative effects, also described here by Grainger as a vermifuge or drug used to eliminate parasitic worms from the body.

[^f131n5]: Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.  

[^f131n6]: The cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*). Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic, and it was supposedly used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles (Riddell 82-83).

> the English. The fruit has no resemblance to a cherry, either in shape or size; and bears, at its lower extremity, a nut (which the Spaniards name *Anacardo*, and physicians *Anacardium*) that resembles a large kidney-bean. Its kernel is as grateful as an almond,[^f132n6] and more easy of digestion. Between its rhinds[^f132n7] is contained a highly caustic oil; which, being held to a candle, emits bright salient sparkles, in which the American fortune-tellers pretended they saw spirits who gave answers to whatever questions were put to them by their ignorant followers. This oil is used as a cosmetic by the ladies, to remove freckles and sun-burning; but the pain they necessarily suffer makes its use not very frequent. This tree also produces a gum not inferior to Gum-Arabic;[^f132n8] and its bark is an approved astringent. The juice of the cherry stains exceedingly. The long citron, or amber-coloured, is the best. The cashew-nuts, when unripe, are of a green colour; but, ripe, they assume that of a pale olive. This tree bears fruit but once a year.

[^f132n1]: The rheums refers to mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illnesses. Dysentery is a gastrointestinal disorder that remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Hydrops refers to an accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy. The modern term is edema (or oedema).  

[^f132n2]: Probably refers to the green turtle (*Chelonia mydas*), the only species of turtle indigenous to the Caribbean that has served as a significant food source for human beings.  

[^f132n3]: A chronic condition affecting the skin and nerves, caused by the microorganism *Mycobacterium leprae*.  

[^f132n4]: Geophagy or pica are the medical terms used for the practice of eating dirt. Eighteenth-century physicians and planters were fascinated with geophagy, which they believed to be a disorder that led to death. In certain instances, they posited that eating dirt was a means of committing suicide and thus a form of enslaved resistance.  

[^f132n5]: Chlorosis \(also called green sickness\) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

[^f132n6]: *Prunus dulcis*, primarily native to western Asia. 

[^f132n7]: The \"Errata\" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "rhinds" should read "rinds."  

[^f132n8]: Edible sap of some trees in the genus *Acacia*. Used as a binder or stabilizer in foods and medicines.

[^f133n2]: Greek god of healing.  

[^f133n3]: Here, Grainger makes a specific recommendation about the "seasoning" of newly transported enslaved Africans. Seasoning was a term used during the eighteenth century to describe the process of acclimatization that it was believed all individuals went through when moving from one climate to another. Physicians believed that patients were more susceptible to illness and death in the weeks and months after they first arrived in new climates. This observation was broadly true for those who were new to the Caribbean but not because there was something inherently harmful about its climate. Instead, travel across long distances often meant coming into contact with new and potentially fatal diseases like yellow fever or typhus. Grainger recommends that enslaved Africans be seasoned for a year and be given easy versus strenuous labor, although such a practice would have been uncommon.  

[^f133n4]: Dried cattle feed (e.g., hay).  

[^f133n5]: Family of marine molluscs best know for their large shells, which can be used as musical horns when properly blown.  

[^f133n6]: This and the following forty lines are the only ones in the poem where the narrator addresses the enslaved directly. Despite this direct address, the passage is framed by a set of rhetorical questions that help the planter justify his actions to himself. The justifications that follow were standard to pro-slavery tracts.  

[^f133n7]: Having to do with Tartarus, the part of the Greek underworld reserved for the wicked. Here, Grainger refers to the work of miners. Improved technology in the seventeenth century facilitated the construction of deeper coal mines in Scotland, where coal became a major domestic export. Deep mines, sometimes extending hundreds of feet into the earth, were necessary because the rising demand for coal quickly exhausted accessible deposits.

> VER. 181. *rocky Drave,*\] A river in Hungary, on whose banks are found mines of quicksilver.  

[^f134n1]: Scotland.  

[^f134n2]: Southwestern Scotland had produced lead since the Roman period. The Scottish Habeas Corpus Act of 1701 did not apply to those in servitude in the coal and lead mines of Scotland. As a result, they could be tied in serf-like bondage to employers by ancient custom. According to the terms of such bondage, they could be sold or leased with the undertaking of mining work and were counted as a part of employers' inventory. Also, vagabonds and their families could be seized and returned to work. Born in Scotland himself, Grainger was aware of this history, and this stanza deliberately compares enslaved Africans to Scottish miners to mitigate the violence of the African slave trade. It would not be until 1774 that an emancipation act forbade mine owners from accepting new servitudes and provided for the emancipation of existing workers who had served for a certain number of years. Only in 1799 were all miners legally freed.  

[^f134n3]: Paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

[^f134n4]: A river in central Europe that forms the boundary between Croatia and Hungary. 

[^f134n5]: Quicksilver or mercury, which was a major export of the region. Among the effects of continued exposure to mercury are palsies (line 180) and loss of teeth (line 193).  

[^f134n6]: The Incan Empire extended from modern Ecuador to Chile in the early sixteenth century, when Spanish conquistadors arrived and imposed colonial rule. In the fifteen lines that follow, Grainger relies on the trope of the Black Legend to suggest that the suffering of the Incas at the hands of the Spanish was far worse than anything experienced by enslaved persons working on British sugar plantations. In particular, the silver mines at Potosí in Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) drove Spanish settlement, and indigenous populations were subjected to the *encomienda* system, in which an *encomendero* accepted tribute and obligatory labor from natives in return for protection. In the early seventeenth century, this system gave way to a *corregimiento* system that established networks of provincial governors who managed the labor distribution and tributary arrangements. Enslaved Africans were also imported and put to work in mines when labor ran short and gradually surpassed the natives in population. Besides silver, gold deposits were found throughout the Andes from Venezuela to Chile, and European colonists greatly expanded the extant mining work of the indigenous Americans in scale.  

[^f134n7]: proud insulting tyrants. The Spanish conquistadors.

- OH, did the tender muse possess the power,[^f136n5]

[^f136n1]: From here to the end of *The Sugar-Cane*, Grainger settles on a strategy of amelioration for dealing with the problem of slavery. This strategy involves accepting the continuation of slavery as an institution but advocating for the humane treatment of the enslaved as an economically prudent measure. Note that his recommendations mirror the actions of Montano at the end of Book I.  

[^f136n2]: Slavery did exist in Africa, although it is clear that the Atlantic slave trade fundamentally altered how it was practiced and the number of people who experienced enslavement. Grainger's reference to slavery in Africa is a conventional move of pro-slavery writers, who invoked it in an attempt to justify and excuse slavery in American plantations.  

[^f136n3]: Indus, a river in southern Asia, rising in the Kailas mountain range in Tibet and flowing through India and Pakistan.  

[^f136n4]: Country or farm laborers, shepherds. The swain is a key figure in georgic poetry.  

[^f136n5]: In this stanza, Grainger claims that he would abolish slavery if his poetry had the power to do so. The next ten lines contain the only explicitly abolitionist sentiments in the poem and would be quoted positively in later abolitionist tracts. See, for example, Nathaniel Appleton's *Considerations on Slavery* (1767).

[^f137n1]: A direct acknowledgment of the tyranny of slavery. Note that tyranny, an increasingly discussed topic during the late eighteenth-century Age of Revolutions, appears several more times in Book IV.  

[^f137n2]: Grainger claims that even after they were freed, formerly enslaved Africans would continue to work on sugar plantations by choice, but this sentiment was a pro-slavery fantasy that was not borne out by reality after emancipation.  

[^f137n3]: The abrubt shift in tone marks Grainger's turn away from his abolitionist fantasy and toward a policy of amelioration, in which physicians like himself were to play a central role. Recall his words at the end of the preface: "I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet." See also Steven Thomas' "Doctoring Ideology."  

[^f137n4]: Guinea worm or the dragon worm (*Dracunculus medinensis*) is a parasitic nematode acquired by drinking water contaminated by the water flea (genus *Cyclops*), which carries the worm's larvae. The larvae break through the stomach lining and enter the bloodstream, growing to full size within a year. A pregnant female worm lives in connective tissues beneath the skin and eventually will release its larvae into a large blister, usually on the legs or arms. The worm's migration produces such symptoms as itching, giddiness, breathing difficulties, vomiting, and diarrhea. The worm may come out spontaneously with the released larvae, but treatment typically involves attaching the worm to the end of a stick and winding it slowly out of the opening in the skin over the course of several days (the "leaden cylinder" that Grainger mentions in line 252 refers to this form of treatment). A broken worm causes an extreme allergic reaction that can be fatal, and blisters on the skin may ulcerate and become infected, resulting in an abscess and the "annual lameness" of which Grainger warns in line 255. Today, the worm may also be treated through anthelmintics.  

[^f137n5]: Moor, a name for a native or inhabitant of Mauretania in North Africa (modern Morocco and Algeria versus Mauritania).

> VER. 257. *winged insects*] These, by the English, are called *Chigoes* or *Chigres*. They chiefly perforate the toes, and sometimes the fingers; occasioning an itching, which some people think not unpleasing, and are at pains to get, by going to the copper-holes, or mill-round, where chigres most abound. They lay their nits in a bag, about the size of a small pea, and are partly contained therein themselves. This the Negroes extract without bursting, by means of a needle, and filling up the place with a little snuff; it soon heals, if the person has a good constitution. One species of them is supposed to be poisonous; but, I believe, unjustly. When they bury themselves near a tendon, especially if the person is in a bad habit of body, they occasion troublesome sores. The South-Americans call them *Miguas*.

> VER. 268. *niccars*] The botanical name of this medicinal shrub is *Guilandina*. The fruit resembles marbles, though not so round. Their shell is hard and smooth, and contains a farinaceous[^f138n6] nut, of admirable use in seminal weaknesses. They are also given to throw out the yaws. 

[^f138n1]: *Dracunculus medinensis* (see note to line 246).  

[^f138n2]: Chigres, chiggers, or chegoes (*Tunga penetrans*), a flea indigenous to Central and South America. This parasitic insect embeds itself and lays its eggs in the flesh of human hosts. Like the Guinea worm, chegoes were both horrifying and fascinating to European observers, who described them in detail. One such important description occurs in Richard Ligon's *A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657), where an enslaved indigenous woman named Yarico is praised for her skill in removing chegoes. This same Yarico became an important literary figure in the eighteenth century via the story of Inkle and Yarico, which was first told by Ligon himself and then retold as a sentimental tale in Richard Steele and Joseph Addison's *The Spectator* (No. 11, 13 March 1711).  

[^f138n3]: Black.  

[^f138n4]: Yaws or *frambesia tropica* is an extremely contagious skin infection caused by the *Treponema pallidum* spirochete. Physicians associated it primarily with enslaved persons, although Europeans and creoles were also subject to infection. In its early stages, yaws produces skin lesions and ulcers, and it can become debilitating if left untreated for a period of years. By the late eighteenth century, Europeans began to associate severe cases of yaws with obeah men. For example, see Benjamin Moseley's *A Treatise on Sugar* (1799). For more on obeah men, see [internal] "Obeah" on this site.  

[^f138n5]: Flowers of sulphur refers to a light yellow, crystalline powder made by distilling sulphur. The knicker nut (*Guilandina bonduc*) is a flowering legume whose native range is the subtropical and tropical parts of the world.  

[^f138n6]: Consisting or made of flour or meal, starchy.

[^f139n2]: Mercury \(or quicksilver\) when taken as mercuric chloride (calomel). An important purgative in eighteenth-century medicine. Could also cause excessive salivation.   

[^f139n3]: The action of contaminating, polluting, or infecting something, especially the blood or skin. In this case, the periodic eruption of yaws sores.

[^f139n4]: Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.

[^f139n5]: Because yaws, like smallpox, seemed to infect a person only once in life, Grainger wonders whether inoculation might not be a good way to fight yaws. Popularized in Europe and the Americas as a treatment against smallpox in 1722, inoculation involved puncturing the skin of a healthy individual and deliberately infecting him or her with pustulent matter from a live smallpox sore. This procedure was extremely dangerous by modern standards because the virus was not attenuated and the inoculee came down with a case of smallpox. Inoculation nevertheless had a much lower rate of mortality than being infected by smallpox naturally.

[^f140n1]: In Greek mythology, Proteus, an old man and shepherd on the island of Pharos near Egypt, was able to shape-shift. The worms' ability to cause multiple maladies and symptoms is equated to Proteus's shape-shifting abilities.

> VER. 317. *The mineral product of the Cornish mine*\] Tin-filings are a better vermifuge than tin in powder. The western parts of Britain, and the neighbouring isles, have been famous for this useful metal from the remotest antiquity; for we find from Strabo,[^f141n5] that the Phaenicians made frequent voyages to those parts (which they called *Cassiterides* from *&#922;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#953; &#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;*[^f141n6] stannum) in quest of that commodity, which turned out so beneficial to them, that a pilot of that nation stranded his vessel, rather than show a Roman ship, that watched him, the way to those mines. For this public spirited action he was amply rewarded, says that accurate writer, upon his return to his country. The Romans, however, soon made themselves masters of the secret, and shared with them in the profit of that merchandize.

[^f141n1]: Gilmore suggests that this is knotted grass (*Spigelia anthelmia*), a plant known for its ability to rid the body of intestinal parasites, including tapeworms. Its native range is the tropical and subtropical Americas.  

[^f141n2]: Places of tin deposits in Cornwall and the surrounding areas in western Britain. Grainger notes that tin acts as an effective vermifuge.

[^f141n3]: Inhabitants of Tyre, a town on the Mediterranean coast in southern Lebanon. It was a major Phoenician seaport for trade from 2000 BCE through the Roman period.

[^f141n4]: Attica, the ancient district of east-central Greece, its chief city being Athens. Maritime trade far surpassed its agriculture.

[^f143n4]: Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), a Genoese-born explorer. The purpose of his famed 1492 voyage was to discover a western route to Asia. He set sight on the island of Guanahani (in the Bahamas) on October 12. Columbus completed four voyages to the Americas during his lifetime.  

[^f143n5]: Lusitania's. Lusitania (now modern Portugal) was an ancient region of western Iberia inhabited by the Lusitani but also by other peoples, including Celtic tribes.  

[^f143n6]: Grainger suggests that the symptoms he lists in the following lines (moping, silence, solitude, loss of appetite) are not real and perhaps feigned. One should be cautious about diagnosing historical illnesses retrospectively, but these same symptoms would come to be described as "fixed melancholy" in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Often associated with longing for friends and family, fixed melancholy became a common diagnosis for the enslaved, and physicians expressed concern that the illness would lead to suicide.  

[^f143n7]: This and the preceding five lines mark the beginning of Grainger's description of obeah, a complex of religious and medical practices designed to help the enslaved negotiate the hardships and demands of living and working on the plantation. By a conjurer, Grainger means an "obeah man" or obeah practitioner, who frequently were associated with snakes, lizards, and other creatures in colonial and European accounts. For more on obeah and how it was portrayed, see [internal] "Obeah" on this site.

> blacks imagine that its blow, if not mortal, will at least occasion long and troublesome disorders. A belief in magic is inseparable from human nature, but those nations are most addicted thereto, among whom learning, and of course, philosophy have least obtained. As in all other countries, so in Guinea,[^f144n3] the conjurers, as they have more understanding, so are they almost always more wicked than the common herd of their deluded countrymen; and as the negroe-magicians can do mischief, so they can also do good on a plantation, provided they are kept by the white people in proper subordination.

> VER. 410. *broom-bush*\] This small plant, which grows in every pasture, may, with propriety, be termed an American clock; for it begins every forenoon at eleven to open its yellow flowers, which about one are fully expanded, and at two closed. The jalap, or marvel of Peru, unfolds its petals between five and six in the evening, which shut again as soon as night comes on, to open again in the cool of the morning. This plant is called four o'clock by the natives, and bears either a yellow or purple-coloured flower.

> VER. 415. *solanum*\] So some authors name the fire-weed, which grows every where, and is the *datura* of Linnaeus;[^f146n5] whose virtues Dr. Stork, at Vienna,[^f146n6] has greatly extolled in a late publication. It bears a white monopetalous flower, which opens always about sun-set.

[^f146n1]: A bed made from stiff and hollow plants.  

[^f146n2]: Gilmore identifies the broom bush as possibly *Sida acuta*, a plant native to Central America with yellow flowers that open in the morning.  

[^f146n3]: *Mirabilis jalapa*. Also known as the four o'clock flower because its flowers open in the afternoon. Probably native to Mexico; used by the Aztecs as an ornamental. Sometimes believed to be native to the Peruvian Andes because it was exported from that region to Europe in the 1500s.  

[^f146n4]: *Datura stramonium*, also known as fireweed or jimsonweed. Probably originated in the tropical regions of Central and South America.

[^f147n1]: Grainger addresses the fact that, in order to economize on costs, planters did not provide enslaved laborers with enough food. Likewise, they wanted to maximize the amount of fertile land was dedicated to sugar cane and therefore did not engage in the large-scale cultivation of provision crops. In addition to working full-time to produce sugar and other commodity crops, then, enslaved laborers were frequently required to cultivate provision grounds or gardens to supplement their diets. The lands allotted for provision grounds were generally rocky, mountainous plots with poor soil.  

[^f147n2]: Beans or peas, as they were often called in the Caribbean, were a major source of nutrition for the enslaved. English beans are also known as fava, broad, or horse beans (*Vicia faba*), which originated in Western Asia thousands of years ago and spread from there to Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. They were sometimes sent from England to the Caribbean to serve as provisions. They also formed part of the provisions of slave ships. The horse bean was not as central to the diets of the enslaved as other bean species, however, many of which were cultivated by the enslaved themselves. Rice also did not make up a major part of the diets of the enslaved in the Caribbean, but South Carolina was the major Atlantic exporter of the rice species known as *Oryza sativa*, which originated in Asia. There is also a species of rice indigenous to Africa known as *Oryza glaberrima*. Enslaved persons may occasionally have grown both *Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima* in their provision grounds and gardens.  

[^f147n3]: Iërne is a term for Ireland, which supplied Caribbean plantations with salted beef and other provisions. Beef also came from the North American colonies, as did flour. 

[^f147n4]: The waters off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic constituted one of the major fisheries of the world for the Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) in the eighteenth century. Planters imported cod for enslaved laborers, who needed protein, but they imported what came to be known as "West India cod," which was salted cod of the poorest quality.

> VER. 449. *cassada*\] To an antient Carribean, bemoaning the savage uncomfortable life of his countrymen, a deity clad in white apparel appeared, and told him, he would have come sooner to have taught him the ways of civil life, had he been addressed before. He then showed him sharp-cutting stones to fell trees and build houses; and bade him cover them with the palm leaves. Then he broke his staff in three; which, being planted, soon after produced cassada. See Ogilvy's America.[^f148n6]

> VER. 454. *angola*\] This is called *Pidgeon-pea*, and grows on a sturdy shrub, that will last for years. It is justly reckoned among the most wholesome legumens. The juice of the leaves, dropt into the eye, will remove incipient films. The botanic name is *Cytisus*.

[^f148n1]: Enslaved laborers were generally required to go to their provision grounds one day per week to tend them. In certain colonies, however, an internal marketing system gradually emerged that may have encouraged some to spend extra time cultivating their provision grounds. For instance, in Jamaica, those who participated in the system were able to sell or trade their provisions for other goods and currency. They were also able to supplement the inadequate diet provided to them by planters, although those individuals who cultivated provision grounds did not enjoy, on average, better health or longer lifespans than those dependent primarily on imported rations. Still, the provision grounds did offer their cultivators some control over what they ate, as they were responsible for choosing what plants to cultivate, and, in limited cases, they also offered some degree of economic autonomy. They also laid the foundation for agricultural production in the British Caribbean in the years following emancipation. Eschewing the model of industrial agriculture represented by the plantation, the newly freed turned instead to small-scale farming.  

[^f148n2]: One of many species of tubers within the *Dioscorea* genus. One of the most important food crops for enslaved persons in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as crucially, yams formed a part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Although there is one South American species of yam (*Dioscorea trifida*) that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, more important species to the diets of the enslaved were *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa, and *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century (Higman 72-81).  

[^f148n3]: Cassava \(*Manihot esculenta*\), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era and subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well, although it was not as important a food source as the yam. Nevertheless, it still appeared in provision grounds because it is an easy crop to cultivate: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. These advantages offset cassava's toxic nature: its roots, which are the parts of the plant prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw roots are poisonous to human beings. The poison can be neutralized by proper processing, however: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads (Higman 61-69).  

[^f148n4]: Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that has historically been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of the enslaved because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

[^f148n5]: A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) whose native range includes the Cape Verde Islands, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.

They commonly bear in six weeks. Their pulse is wholesome, though somewhat flatulent; especially those from the black and red. The pods are flattish, two or three inches long; and contain from three to five seeds in partitional cells.

> VER. 457. *Ochra*\] Or *Ockro*. This shrub, which will last for years, produces a not less agreeable, than wholesome pod. It bears all the year round. Being of a slimy and balsamic nature, it becomes a truly medicinal aliment in dysenteric complaints. It is of the *Malva* species. It rises to about four or five feet high, bearing, on and near the summit, many yellow flowers; succeeded by green, conic, fleshy pods, channelled into several grooves. There are as many cells filled with small round seeds, as there are channels.

> VER. 459. *potatos*\] I cannot positively say, whether these vines are of Indian original or not; but as in their fructification, they differ from potatos at home, they probably are not European. They are sweet. There are four kinds, the red, the white, the long, and round: The juice of each may be made into a pleasant cool drink; and, being distilled, yield an excellent spirit.[^f149n7]

> VER. 461. *eddas*\] See notes on Book I. The French call this plant *Tayove*. It produces eatable roots every four months, for one year only.

> VER. 462. *Indian cale*\] This green, which is a native of the New World, equals any of the greens in the Old.

> VER. 462. *calaloo*\] Another species of Indian pot-herb, no less wholesome than the preceding. These, with mezamby,[^f149n8] and the Jamaica prickle-weed,[^f149n9] yield to no esculent[^f149n10] plants in Europe. This is an Indian name.

[^f149n1]: Okra \(*Abelmoschus esculentus*\) is probably native to Africa and was one of the most commonly cultivated plants in the provision grounds and gardens of the enslaved. It possesses a glutinous or slimy pulp that was used as a thickener in stews called pepper pots, one of the most popular dishes in the colonial Caribbean (Higman 174-175).  

[^f149n2]: Grainger refers to sweet potatoes (*Ipomoea batatas*), which probably originated in Central America or northwestern South America.  

[^f149n3]: Edda or eddo commonly referred to taro (*Colocasia esculenta*). It is also, however, sometimes referred to as yautia (*Xanthosoma sagittifolium*). Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by the enslaved because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. *Colocasia esculenta* originated in southeastern or southern Central Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 CE. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* has a native range extending from Costa Rica to tropical South America (Higman 82-86).  

[^f149n4]: The term "Indian cale" also can refer to the species *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. Since the seventeenth century, "callaloo" has been used to refer to several different plants. Today, callaloo usually refers to *Amaranthus viridis*, a plant whose native range is the tropical Americas. What the various plants labeled callaloo had in common was the ability of their leaves to serve as edible greens. They are also weedy plants that can survive in a wide range of environments, including wastelands. They formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved, probably because they were a hardy and reliable source of food (Higman 100-107).  

[^f149n5]: Mint refers to plants of the genus *Mentha*, distributed around the world. Thyme refers to plants of the genus *Thymus*, whose native range extends from Greenland and temperate and subtropical Eurasia to northeastern tropical Africa. Balm is the name of various aromatic plants, particularly those of the genera *Melissa* and *Melittis*.  

[^f149n6]: Butterfly-shaped.

[^f149n7]: Mobby or mobbie, an alcoholic drink made from the sweet potato. The origin of the drink's name is Carib.  

[^f149n8]: Gilmore identifies mezamby as probably *Cleome gynandra*, a plant whose native range is the tropical and subtropical Old World.  

[^f149n9]: Might refer to *Amaranthus spinosus*, a plant sometimes known as prickly callaloo. Its native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas.   

[^f149n10]: Suitable for food, edible.

[^f150n1]: Grainger refers here to various citrus trees, which originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the lime (*Citrus aurantifolia*) and the citron (*Citrus medica*) (Higman 175). 

[^f150n2]: Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. 

[^f150n3]: Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[^f150n4]: Another name for cacao. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[^f150n5]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts. 

[^f150n6]: Cacao trees take several years to produce pods that can be harvested.  

[^f150n7]: Cacao seeds are ground up to produce chocolate, which was branded as early as the seventeenth century as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is possible that maroons living in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food, too (Hughes, *The American Physitian* 131).

> VER. 502. *mammey*\] This is a lofty, shady, and beautiful tree. Its fruit is as large as the largest melon, and of an exquisite smell, greatly superior to it in point of taste. Within the fruit are contained one or two large stones, which when distilled, give to spirits a ratafia flavour,[^f151n9] and therefore the French call them *Les apricots de St. Domingue*:[^f151n10] accordingly, the *l'eau des noiaux*, one of the best West-Indian cordials, is made from them.[^f151n11] The fruit, eaten raw, is of an aperient[^f151n12] quality; and made into sweet-meats,[^f151n13]

> *&c.* is truly exquisite. This tree, contrary to most others in the New World, shoots up to a pyramidal figure: the leaves are uncommonly green; and it produces fruit, but once a year. The name is Indian. The English commonly call it *Mammey-sapota*. There are two species of it, the sweet, and the tart.[^f152n5] The botanical name is *Achras*.

> VER. 509. *tamarind*\] See Book I. p. 44.

[^f152n1]: A term used in the ancient and medieval periods to signify man-eaters. It is now much less used than the term cannibal, which Columbus invented to name the Carib peoples that he encountered in the Americas. Columbus suggested that the Caribs were "Caniba" or subjects of the Great Khan, whose lands he was hoping to find. He also suggested that the Caribs ate human flesh, although there is little to no evidence that they actually did.  

[^f152n2]: The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*) is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

[^f152n3]: Cassia is probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka.  

[^f152n4]: *Annona cherimola*, a fruit that originated in South America and is perhaps native to Ecuador.  

[^f152n5]: The mammee sapota is actually different from the mammee apple (the fruit Grainger describes in lines 502-508). The mammee sapota (*Pouteria sapota*) is a sweet fruit whose native range is Mexico and Central America. Another fruit commonly confused with both the mammee sapota and the mammee apple is the nasebery (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the sapodilla or the nispero. It is a sour or tart fruit whose native range is Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (Higman 196-197).

> VER. 523. *palmeto*,\] This being the most beautiful of palms, nay, perhaps, superior to any other known tree in the world, has with propriety obtained the name of *Royal*. The botanical name is *Palma Maxima*. It will shoot up perpendicularly to an hundred feet and more. The stem is perfectly circular; only towards the root, and immediately under the branches at top, it bulges out. The bark is smooth, and of an ash-brown colour, except at the top where it is green. It grows very fast, and the seed from whence it springs is not bigger than an acorn. In this, as in all the palm-genus, what the natives call *Cabbage* is found; but it resembles in taste an almond, and is in fact the pith of the upper, or greenish part of the stem. But it would be the most unpardonable luxury to cut down so lovely a tree, for so mean a gratification; especially as the wild, or mountain cabbage tree, sufficiently supplies the table with that esculent. I never ride past the charming vista of royal palms on the Cayon-estate of Daniel Mathew, Esq; in St. Christopher,[^f153n6] without being put in mind of the pillars of the Temple of the Sun at Palmyra.[^f153n7] This tree grows on the tops of hills, as well as in valleys; its hard cortical part makes very durable laths for houses.[^f153n8] There is a smaller species not quite so beautiful.

[^f153n1]: Grainger is referring to what he calls elsewhere the royal palm (*Roystonea oleracea*), which can reach forty meters in height and is native to the Lesser Antilles, northern South America, and Guatemala.

[^f153n2]: Inigo Jones (1573-1652) was an English architect and theatre designer. Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was an English architect, mathematician, and astronomer.

> VER. 534. *anata*,\] Or *Anotto*, or *Arnotta*; thence corruptly called *Indian Otter*, by the English. The tree is about the size of an ordinary apple-tree. The French call it *Rocou*; and send the farina home as a paint, *&c.* for which purpose the tree is cultivated by them in their islands. The flower is pentapetalous, of a bluish and spoon-like appearance. The yellow filaments are tipped with purplish apices.[^f154n3] The style proves the rudiment of the succeeding pod, which is of a conic shape, an inch and a half long. This is divided into many cells, which contain a great number of small seeds, covered with a red farina.

> VER. 543. *granadilla*\] This is the Spanish name, and is a species of the *passiflora*, or passion-flower, called by Linnaeus *Musa*. The seeds and pulp, through which the seeds are dispersed, are cooling, and grateful to the palate. This, as well as the water-lemon, bell-apple, or honeysuckle, as it is named,[^f154n4] being parasitical plants, are easily formed into cooling arbors, than which nothing can be more grateful in warm climates. Both fruits are wholesome. The granadilla is commonly eat with sugar, on account of its tartness, and yet the pulp is viscid.[^f154n5] Plumier calls it *Granadilla*, *latefolia*, *fructu maliformi*. It grows best in shady places. The unripe fruit makes an excellent pickle.

[^f154n1]: Also anatta, anatto, or annatto. Refers to *Bixa orellana*, a low, shrubby tree native to the tropical Americas that was used from precolonial times by indigenous peoples to produce a reddish-orange dye.

[^f155n2]: Coco refers to the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*), which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia. It has great powers of natural disperal since its nuts (the coconuts) can survive up to 120 days in seawater. Nevertheless, it is believed that Europeans introduced the coconut palm to the Caribbean in the sixteenth century.

The stones, seeds, or *acini*, contained in them, are large in proportion; and, being reduced to a powder, are an excellent astringent. The bark of the tree has the same property. The grapes, steept in water and fermented with sugar, make an agreeable wine.

> VER. 567. *Indian millet*\] Or maise. This is commonly called *Guinea-corn*, to distinguish it from the great or Indian-corn, that grows in the southern parts of North-America.[^f156n4] It soon shoots up to a great height, often twenty feet high, and will ratoon like the other; but its blades are not so nourishing to horses as those of the great corn, although its seeds are more so, and rather more agreeable to the taste. The Indians, Negroes, and poor white people, make many (not unsavoury) dishes with them. It is also called *Turkey wheat*. The turpentine tree[^f156n5] will also grow in the sand, and is most useful upon a plantation. 

[^f156n1]: By Indian millet, Grainger means Guinea corn (*Sorghum bicolor*). Often planted in the provision grounds of the enslaved and a key source of food, as indicated by an eighteenth-century song sung by the enslaved that declares, "Guinea Corn, I long to see you/Guinea Corn, I long to plant you/Guinea Corn, I long to mould you/Guinea Corn, I long to weed you...Guinea Corn, I long to eat you" (qtd. in Higman 231). 

[^f156n2]: Bananas and plantains (family Musaceae) are closely related. Both formed a part of the diets of the enslaved, although plantains were by far a more significant source of food than bananas. Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. They subsequently were introduced to the Caribbean by the Spanish (Higman 134).  

[^f156n3]: Vantages, heights, summits.

[^f156n4]: Maize, great corn, and Indian corn are all different names for *Zea mays*.

[^f157n1]: A nymph of springs, rivers, and lakes in Greek mythology. 

[^f157n2]: This stanza describes the dances that the enslaved participated in on days of rest and holidays. The banshaw is another name for the banjo, an instrument that originated in Africa and arrived with the enslaved in the Americas. There, it evolved, as did the music played on it, to become an integral part of Afro-Caribbean and African American musical cultures. European colonists in the early Caribbean were fascinated both by the banjo and the music and dancing of the enslaved. For example, Hans Sloane (1660-1753), a physician and naturalist who visited Jamaica in the seventeenth century, got someone to transcribe some of the songs that he heard. He included these transcriptions in *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). These songs can be heard at www.musicalpassage.org, a site created by Laurent Dubois, David K. Garner, Mary Caton Lingold, and others. Although colonists may have understood the dances and music as entertainment, Dubois and others have argued that dance and music helped the enslaved create spaces of autonomy for themselves, as they moved and created sounds that hearkened back to the performance traditions of Africa.

> VER. 611. *prickly vine*\] This beautiful white rosaceous flower is as large as the crown of one's hat, and only blows[^f158n4] at midnight. The plant, which is prickly and attaches itself firmly to the sides of houses, trees, *&c.* produces a fruit, which some call *Wythe Apple*, and others with more propriety, *Mountain strawberry*. But though it resembles the large Chili-strawberry[^f158n5] in looks and size; yet being inelegant of taste, it is seldom eaten. The botanical name is *Cereus scandens minor*. The rind of the fruit is here and there studded with tufts of small sharp prickles.

[^f158n1]: Various colonies throughout the Caribbean and North America outlawed the use of drums and horns, which had military uses in Africa and were believed to be capable of inciting rebellion among the enslaved. St. Kitts passed laws banning drum and horn use in 1711 and 1722.

[^f158n2]: Planters were often concerned about the enslaved marrying across plantations, since they believed that such marriages would lead to lost time from work. They also believed that traveling between plantations would foster ideas of independence since such travel often happened at night, when it would be easier for the enslaved to escape the surveillance of planters. 

[^f158n3]: Grainger refers here to the night-blooming cereus (*Selenicereus grandiflorus*), also sometimes known as the queen of the night because of the exquisite beauty and fragrant scent of its large, white flowers. These flowers only open after sunset. Because of this unusual property, the night-blooming cereus became a subject of much speculation and even fantasy on the part of European botanists and observers, who wondered if it could be compared to a nocturnal animal. Botanists today have realized that the flower blooms at night because the cactus' pollinators, which include bats and moths, are nocturnal themselves. They also note the fact that the flower's petals are opalescent and highly visible at night, especially in the moonlight, to attract these pollinators. For more on the night-blooming cereus, see a digital exhibit on "Poetic Botany" created by the New York Botanical Garden (https://www.nybg.org/poetic-botany/selenicereus/). The night-blooming cereus is native to the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua.  

[^f158n4]: blooms. 

[^f158n5]: The Chilean strawberry (*Fragaria chiloensis*) is native to the Pacific Northwest but was probably spread by migratory birds to Hawaii and Chile, where indigenous peoples began cultivating it thousands of years ago. In the eighteenth century, the Chilean strawberry was brought to Europe, where it was crossed with the Virginia strawberry (*Fragaria virginiana*) to create today's commercial strawberry (*Fragaria x ananassa*).

[^f159n8]: Grainger is referring to the *Code noir*, a royal edict issued by Louis XIV in 1685. The *Code noir* contained sixty articles regulating the treatment of the enslaved in the French Caribbean. Although Grainger praises it as protecting the enslaved from abuse, other eighteenth-century observers condemned it as proving the inhumanity of the institution of slavery, since it still allowed masters to inflict harsh punishments on the enslaved and treat them as property.

[^f160n1]: Compare the last fifty lines of the poem to the end of Alexander Pope's *Windsor Forest* (1713), a poem that celebrates Britain's history and culminates with the triumphal image of the Thames river, symbolizing British commerce, spreading across the world, carrying peace and liberty with it.  

[^f160n2]: Rio de la Plata is an estuary formed by the confluence of the Uruguay and the Paraná rivers in South America.

[^f160n3]: If commerce has been the implicit theme of *The Sugar-Cane*, here Grainger personifies it explicitly as the core of Britain's power.

- AH me, what thunders roll! the sky's on fire!
- Now sudden darkness muffles up the pole!
- Heavens! what wild scenes, before the affrighted sense,
- Imperfect swim!—See! in that flaming scroll, [655]
- Which Time unfolds, the future germs bud forth,
- Of mighty empires! independent realms!——
- And must Britannia, Neptune's favourite queen,[^f161n1]
- Protect'ress of true science, freedom, arts;
- Must she, ah! must she, to her offspring crouch? [660]
- Ah, must my Thames, old Ocean's favourite son,
- Resign his trident to barbaric streams;
- His banks neglected, and his waves unsought,
- No bards to sing them, and no fleets to grace?——
- Again the fleecy clouds amuse the eye, [665]
- And sparkling stars the vast horizon gild—
- She shall not crouch; if Wisdom guide the helm,
- Wisdom that bade loud Fame, with justest praise,
- Record her triumphs! bade the lacquaying winds[^f161n2]
- Transport, to every quarter of the globe, [670]
- Her winged navies! bade the scepter'd sons
- Of earth acknowledge her pre-eminence!—
- She shall not crouch; if these Cane ocean-isles,
- Isles which on Britain for their all depend,

[^f161n1]: A reference to Britain's status as the premier naval power during the eighteenth century. 

[^f161n2]: Winds that follow or serve.

- And must for ever; still indulgent share [675]
- Her fostering smile: and other isles be given,
- From vanquish'd foes.—And, see, another race!
- A golden aera dazzles my fond sight! 
- That other race, that long'd-for aera, hail!
- THE BRITISH GEORGE NOW REIGNS, THE PATRIOT KING![^f162n1] [680]
- BRITAIN SHALL EVER TRIUMPH O'ER THE MAIN.

The END of BOOK IV.

[^f162n1]: Perhaps a reference to Henry St. Bolingbroke's *The Idea of a Patriot King* (1749), a treatise written for Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707-1751), on monarchy. It describes in idealized terms the policies and virtuous conduct of a patriot king waiting in the wings. The patriot king's accession was supposed to end political conflicts.
