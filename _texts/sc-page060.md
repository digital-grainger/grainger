[60]()

- From foul pollution, and unseemly rot;
- Much will they benefit thy house and thee.
- But chief the yellow thistle thou select,
- Whose seed the stomach frees from nauseous loads; [115]
- And, if the music of the mountain-dove
- Delight thy pensive ear, sweet friend to thought!
- This prompts their cooing, and enflames their love.
- Nor let rude hands the knotted grass profane,
- Whose juice worms fly: Ah, dire endemial ill! [120]
- How many fathers, fathers now no more;
- How many orphans, now lament thy rage?
- The cow-itch also save; but let thick gloves
- Thine hands defend, or thou wilt sadly rue
- Thy rash imprudence, when ten thousand darts [125]

> VER. 114. *the yellow thistle*\] The seeds of this plant are an excellent emetic; and almost as useful in dysenteric complaints as ipecacuan. It grows every where.

> VER. 119. *Nor let rude hands the knotted grass profane*,\] This is truly a powerful vermifuge; but, uncautiously administered, has often proved mortal. The juice of it clarified, is sometimes given; but a decoction of it is greatly preferable. Its botanical name is *Spigelia*.

> VER. 123. *The cow-itch also save*;\] This extraordinary vine should not be permitted to grow in a Cane-piece; for Negroes have been known to fire the Canes, to save themselves from the torture which attends working in grounds where it has abounded. Mixed with melasses, it is a safe and excellent vermifuge. Its seeds, which resemble blackish small beans, are purgative. Its flower is purple; and its pods, on which the stinging brown *Setae* are found, are as large as a full-grown English field-pea.
