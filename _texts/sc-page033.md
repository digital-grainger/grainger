[33]({{site.baseurl}}/images/{{page.img}})  

- Ere thy tops, trusted to the mountain-land, [455]  
- Commence their jointing: but four moons suffice  
- To bring to puberty the low-land Cane.  

- IN plants, in beasts, in man's imperial race,  
- An alien[^f33n1] mixture meliorates the breed;  
- Hence Canes, that sickened dwarfish on the plain, [460]  
- Will shoot with giant-vigour on the hill.  
- Thus all depends on all; so God ordains.  
- Then let not man for little selfish ends,  
- \(Britain, remember this important truth;\)  
- Presume the principle to counteract [465]  
- Of universal love; for God is love,  
- And wide creation shares alike his care.  

- 'TIS said by some, and not unletter'd they,  
- That chief the Planter, if he wealth desire,  
- Should note the phases of the fickle moon. [470]  
- On thee, sweet empress of the night, depend  
- The tides; stern Neptune[^f33n2] pays his court to thee;  
- The winds, obedient at thy bidding shift,  
- And tempests rise or fall; even lordly man,  
- Thine energy controls.——Not so the Cane; [475]  
- The Cane its independency may boast,  
- Tho' some less noble plants thine influence own.

[^f33n1]: Belonging to another person, place, or family; from elsewhere, foreign.  

[^f33n2]: Roman god of the sea.
