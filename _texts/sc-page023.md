[23]()

- Brigade and squadron, whiten on the sight;
- And fill spectators with an awful joy.

- PLANTER, improvement is the child of time;
- What your sires knew not, ye their offspring know:
- But hath your art receiv'd Perfection's stamp? [280]
- Thou can'st not say.â€”Unprejudic'd, then learn
- Of ancient modes to doubt, and new to try:
- And if Philosophy, with Wisdom, deign
- Thee to enlighten with their useful lore;
- Fair Fame and riches will reward thy toil. [285]

- THEN say, ye swains, whom wealth and fame inspire,
- Might not the plough, that rolls on rapid wheels,
- SAVE no small labour to the hoe-arm'd gang?
- Might not the culture taught the British hinds,
- By Ceres' son, unfailing crops secure; [290]
- Tho' neither dung nor fallowing lent their aid?

- THE cultur'd land recalls the devious Muse;
- Propitious to the planter be the call:
- For much, my friend, it thee imports to know
- The meetest season to commit thy tops, [295]
- With best advantage, to the well-dug mould.
