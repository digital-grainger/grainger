- Nurse of each art; where science yet finds friends
- Amid this waste of waters; wept thy rage?

- THEN trust not, planter, to the unsteddy gale; [225]
- But in Tobago's endless forests fell
- The tall tough hiccory, or calaba.
- Of this, be forc'd two pillars in the ground,
- Four paces distant, and two cubits high:
- Other two pillars raise; the wood the same, [230]
- Of equal size and height. The Calaba
- Than steel more durable, contemns the rain,
- And sun's intensest beam; the worm, that pest
- Of mariners, which winds its fatal way
- Through heart of British oak, reluctant leaves [235]
- The closer calaba.——By transverse beams
- Secure the whole; and in the pillar'd frame,
- Sink, artist, the vast bridge-tree's mortis'd form
- Of ponderous hiccory; hiccory time defies:

> VER. 227. *Hiccory*\] This is a lofty spreading tree, of very hard wood, excellently adapted to the purposes of the mill-wright. The nut, whose shell is thick, hard, and roughish, contains an agreeable and wholesome kernel. It grows in great abundance in St. Croix, Crab island, and Tobago.
> VER. 227. *Calaba*\] This lofty tree is commonly called Mastic: it is a hard wood, and is found in the places where the Hiccory grows. The flowers are yellow, and are succeeded by a fruit, which bears a distant resemblance to a shrub.
