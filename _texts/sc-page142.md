- Felt his heart wither on his farthest throne.
- Perennial source of population thou!
- While scanty peasants plough the flowery plains
- Of purple Enna;[^f142n1] from the Belgian fens,[^f142n2] [330]
- What swarms of useful citizens spring up,
- Hatch'd by thy fostering wing. Ah where is flown
- That dauntless free-born spirit, which of old,
- Taught them to shake off the tyrannic yoke[^f142n3]
- Of Spains insulting King; on whose wide realms, [335]
- The sun still shone with undiminished beam?
- Parent of wealth! in vain, coy nature hoards
- Her gold and diamonds; toil, thy firm compeer,
- And industry of unremitting nerve,
- Scale the cleft mountain, the loud torrent brave, [340]
- Plunge to the center, and thro' Nature's wiles,
- (Led on by skill of penetrative soul)
- Her following close, her secret treasures find,
- To pour them plenteous on the laughing world.
- On thee Sylvanus,[^f142n4] thee each rural god, [345]
- On thee chief Ceres,[^f142n5] with unfailing love
- And fond distinction, emulously gaze.
- In vain hath nature pour'd vast seas between
- Far-distant kingdoms; endless storms in vain
