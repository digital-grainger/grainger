- \(Ere Phosphor[^f93n1] his pale circlet yet withdraws,
- What time grey dawn stands tip-toe on the hill,\)
- O'er the rich Cane-grove: Muse, their labour sing. [110]

- SOME bending, of their sapless burden ease
- The yellow jointed canes,[^f93n2] \(whose height exceeds
- A mounted trooper, and whose clammy round
- Measures two inches full;\) and near the root
- Lop the stem off, which quivers in their hand [115]
- With fond impatience: soon it's branchy spires,
- \(Food to thy cattle\) it resigns; and soon
- It's tender prickly tops, with eyes[^f93n3] thick set,
- To load with future crops thy long-hoed land.
- These with their green, their pliant branches bound, [120]
- \(For not a part of this amazing plant,
- But serves some useful purpose\) charge the young:
- Not laziness declines this easy toil;
- Even lameness from it's leafy pallet crawls,
- To join the favoured gang. What of the Cane [125]
- Remains, and much the largest part remains,
- Cut into junks[^f93n4] a yard in length, and tied
- In small light bundles; load the broad-wheel'd wane,
- The mules crook-harnest, and the sturdier crew,

[^f93n1]: The morning star or the planet Venus when found in the sky before sunrise.  
[^f93n2]: Sugar cane turns yellow when it is ripe.  
[^f93n3]: Sugar-cane buds. To produce new sugar cane, sugar cane stalks with buds on them were planted in the ground.  
[^f93n4]: A gathering of stems or stalks.
