[113]()

- Serves needful purposes. Are barbecues
- The cates thou lov'st? What like rich skimmings feed [480]
- The grunting, briefly kind? Your labouring mules
- They soon invigorate: Give old Baynard these,
- Untir'd he trudges in his destin'd round;
- Nor need the driver crack his horrid lash.

- YET, with small quantities indulge the steed, [485]
- Whom skimmings ne'er have fatten'd: else, too fond,
- So gluttons use, he'll eat intemperate meals;
- And, staggering, fall the prey of ravening sharks.

- BUT say, ye boon compnaions, in what strains,
- What grateful strains, shall I record the praise [490]
- Of their best produce, heart-recruiting rum?
- Thrice wholesome spirit! well-matur'd with age,
- Thrice grateful to the palate! when, with thirst,
- With heat, with labour, and wan care opprest,
- I quaff they bowl, where fruit my hands have cull'd, [495]
- Round, golden fruit; where water from the spring,
- Which dripping coolness spreads her umbrage round;
- With hardest, whitest sugar, thrice refin'd;
- Dilates my soul with genuine joy; low care
