[54]()  

- Oft sees red lightning at the midnight-hour,  
- When nod the watches, stream along the sky;  
- Not innocent, as what the learned call  
- The Boreal morn, which, through the azure air, [15]  
- Flashes its tremulous rays, in painted streaks,  
- While o'er night's veil her lucid tresses flow:  
- Nor quits the Muse her walk, immers'd in thought,  
- How she the planter, haply, may advise;  
- Till tardy morn unbar the gates of light, [20]  
- And, opening on the main with sultry beam,  
- To burnish'd silver turns the blue-green wave.  

- SAY, will my SHENSTONE lend a patient ear,  
- And weep at woes unknown to Britain's Isle?  
- Yes, thou wilt weep; for pity chose thy breast, [25]  
- With taste and science, for their soft abode:  
- Yes, thou wilt weep: thine own distress thou bear'st  
- Undaunted; but another's melts thy soul.  

- \"O WERE my pipe as soft, my dittied song\"  
- As smooth as thine, my too too distant friend, [30]  
- SHENSTONE; my soft pipe, and my dittied song  
- Should hush the hurricanes tremendous roar,  
- And from each evil guard the ripening Cane!
