[150]()

- THIS tract secure, with hedges or of limes, [465]
- Or bushy citrons, or the shapely tree
- That glows at once with aromatic blooms,
- And golden fruit mature.[^f150n1] To these be join'd,
- In comely neighbourhood, the cotton shrub;[^f150n2]
- In this delicious clime the cotton bursts [470]
- On rocky soils.—The coffee also plant;[^f150n3]
- White as the skin of Albion's lovely fair,
- Are the thick snowy fragrant blooms it boasts:
- Nor wilt thou, cocô,[^f150n4] thy rich pods refuse;[^f150n5]
- Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require,[^f150n6] [475]
- Ere the stone grind them to the food of health.[^f150n7]
- Of thee, perhaps, and of thy various sorts,
- And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd,[^f150n8]
- With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;
- In future times, the enraptur'd muse may sing: [480]
- If public favour crown her present lay.

- BUT let some antient, faithful slave erect
- His sheltered mansion near; and with his dog,
- His loaded gun, and cutlass, guard the whole:
- Else negro-fugitives,[^f150n9] who skulk 'mid rocks [485]

[^f150n1]: Grainger refers here to various citrus trees, which originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the lime (*Citrus aurantifolia*) and the citron (*Citrus medica*) (Higman 175). 

[^f150n2]: Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. 

[^f150n3]: Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[^f150n4]: Another name for cacao. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

[^f150n5]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts. 

[^f150n6]: Cacao trees take several years to produce pods that can be harvested.  

[^f150n7]: Cacao seeds are ground up to produce chocolate, which was branded as early as the seventeenth century as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is possible that maroons living in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food, too (Hughes, *The American Physitian* 131). 

[^f150n8]: Madre de Cacao (*Gliricidia sepium*). Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[^f150n9]: Grainger refers here to enslaved persons running away from plantations.
