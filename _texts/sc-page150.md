[150]()

- THIS tract secure, with hedges or of limes, [465]
- Or bush citrons, or the shapely tree
- That glows at once with aromatic blooms,
- And golden fruit mature. To these be join'd,
- In comely neighbourhood, the cotton shrub;
- In this delicious clime the cotton bursts [470]
- On rocky soils.—The coffee also plant;
- White as the skin of Albion's lovely fair,
- Are the thick snowy fragrant blooms it boasts:
- Nor wilt thou, cocô, thy rich pods refuse;
- Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require, [475]
- Ere the stone grind them to the food of health.
- Of thee, perhaps, and of thy various sorts,
- And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd,
- With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;
- In future times, the enraptur'd muse may sing: [480]
- If public favour crown her present lay.

- BUT let some antient, faithful slave erect
- His sheltered mansion near; and with his dog,
- His loaded gun, and cutlass, guard the whole:
- Else negro-fugitives, who skulk \'mid rocks [485]
