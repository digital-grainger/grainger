- Tho' lofty Maro (whose immortal muse
- Distant I follow, and, submiss, adore)
- Hath sung its properties, to counteract
- Dire spells, slow-mutter'd o'er the baneful bowl, [135]
- Where cruel stepdames poisonous drugs have brewed;
- Can vie with these low tenants of the vale,
- In driving poisons from the infected frame:
- For here, alas! (ye sons of luxury mark!)
- The sea, tho' on its bosom Halcyons sleep, [140]
- Abounds with poison'd fish; whose crimson fins,
- Whose eyes, whose scales, bedropt with azure, gold,
- Purple, and green, in all gay Summer's pride,
- Amuse the sight; whose taste the palate charms;
- Yet death, in ambush, on the banquet waits, [145]
- Unless these antidotes be timely given.
- But, say what strains, what numbers can recite,
- Thy praises, vervain; or wild liquorice, thine?
- For not the costly root, the gift of God,
