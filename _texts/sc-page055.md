[55]()  

- DESTRUCTIVE, on the upland sugar-groves  
- The monkey-nation preys: from rocky heights, [35]  
- In silent parties, they descend by night,  
- And posting watchful sentinels, to warn  
- When hostile steps approach; with gambols, they  
- Pour o'er the Cane-grove. Luckless he to whom  
- That land pertains! in evil hour, perhaps, [40]  
- And thoughtless of to-morrow, on a die  
- He hazards millions; or, perhaps, reclines  
- On Luxury's soft lap, the pest of wealth;  
- And, inconsiderate, deems his Indian crops  
- Will amply her insatiate wants supply. [45]  

- FROM these insidious droles \(peculiar pest  
- Of Liamuiga's hills\) would'st thou defend  
- Thy waving wealth; in traps put not thy trust,  
- However baited: Treble every watch,  
- And well with arms provide them; faithful dogs, [50]  
- Of nose sagacious, on their footsteps wait.

> VER. 46. *peculiar pest*\] The monkeys which are now so numerous in the mountainous parts of St. Christopher, were brought thither by the French when they possessed half that island. This circumstance we learn from *Pere Labat*, who farther tells us, that they are a most delicate food. The English-Negroes are very fond of them, but the White-inhabitants do not eat them. They do a great deal of mischief in St. Kitts, destroying many thousand pounds *Sterling*'s worth of Canes every year.
