[126]()

- Thine arms, and ankles: O attend my song.
- A muse that pities thy distressful state;
- Who sees, with grief, thy sons in fetters bound; [15]
- Who wishes freedom to the race of man;
- Thy nod assenting craves: dread Genius, come!

- YET vain thy presence, vain thy favouring nod;
- Unless once more the muses, that erewhile
- Upheld me fainting in my past career, [20]
- Through Caribbe's cane-isles; kind condescend
- To guide my footsteps, through parch'd Libya's wilds;
- And bind my sun-burnt brow with other bays,
- Than ever deck'd the Sylvan bard before.

- SAY, will my Melvil, from the public care, [25]
- Withdraw one moment, to the muses shrine?
- Who smit with thy fair fame, industrious cull
- An Indian wreath to mingle with thy bays,
- And deck the hero, and the scholar's brow!
- Wilt thou, whose mildness smooths the face of war, [30]
- Who round the victor-blade the myrtle twin'st,
- And mak'st subjection loyal and sincere;
- O wilt thou gracious hear the unartful strain,
- Whose mild instructions teach, no trivial theme,
