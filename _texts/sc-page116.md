- Butt the young negroes, while their swarthy sires, [535]
- With ardent gladness wield the bill; and hark,
- The crop is finish'd, how they rend the sky!â€”

- NOR, beauteous only shows the cultured soil,
- From this cool station. No less charms the eye
- That wild interminable waste of waves: [540]
- While on the horizon's farthest verge are seen
- Islands of different shape, and different size;
- While sail-clad ships, with their sweet produce fraught,

> VER. 549. *papaws*\] This singular tree, whose fruits surround its summit immediately under the branches and leaves, like a necklace; grows quicker than almost any other in the West Indies. The wood is of no use, being spungy, hollow, and herbacious; however, the blossoms and fruit make excellent sweet-meats;[^f116n2] but above all, the juice of the fruit being rubbed upon a spit, will intenerate[^f116n3] new killed fowls, *&c*. a circumstance of great consequence in a climate, where the warmth soon renders whatever meats are attempted to be made tender by keeping, unfit for culinary purposes.

[^f116n1]: Tamarind refers to the tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*), which is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp is used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes. According to Gilmore, the panspan or hog plum is *Spondias mombin*. Its native range is Mexico to the tropical Americas. The pawpaw is better known as the papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its native range is southern Mexico to Venezuela. 

[^f116n2]: Preserved or candied fruits. 

[^f116n3]: To make tender, soften. 

[^f116n4]: Ringworm, or *tinea*, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.
