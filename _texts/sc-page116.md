[116]()

- Butt the young negroes, while their swarthy sires, [535]
- With ardent gladness wield the bill; and hark,
- The crop is finish'd, how they rend the sky!â€”

- NOR, beauteous only shows the cultured soil,
- From this cool station. No less charms the eye
- That wild interminable waste of waves: [540]
- While on the horizon's farthest verge are seen
- Islands of different shape, and different size;
- While sail-clad ships, with their sweet produce fraught,

> VER. 549. *papaws*\] This singular tree, whose fruits surround its summit immediately under the branches and leaves, like a necklace; grows quicker than almost any other in the West Indies. The wood is of no use, being spungy, hollow, and herbacious; however, the blossoms and fruit make excellent sweet-meats;[^f116n3] but above all, the juice of the fruit being rubbed upon a spit, will intenerate[^f116n4] new killed fowls, *&c*. a circumstance of great consequence in a climate, where the warmth soon renders whatever meats are attempted to be made tender by keeping, unfit for culinary purposes. Nor, will it only intenerate fresh meat; but, being boiled with salted beef, will render it easily digestible. Its milky juice is sometimes used to cure ringworms.[^f116n5] It

[^f116n1]: The tamarind tree (*Tamarindus indica*), which is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

[^f116n2]: Papaws, better known as papaya (*Carica papaya*). Its native range is southern Mexico to Venezuela. 

[^f116n3]: Preserved or candied fruits. 

[^f116n4]: To make tender, soften. 

[^f116n5]: Ringworm, or *tinea*, is the name given to a fungal infection of the skin, scalp, or nails that produces lesions in the shape of partial or complete rings. It spreads by direct contact or through infected materials.
