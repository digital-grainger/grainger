[35]()  

- WITH limes, with lemons, let thy fences glow,  
- Grateful to sense; now children of this clime: [500]  
- And here and there let oranges erect  
- Their shapely beauties, and perfume the sky.  
- Nor less delightful blooms the logwood-hedge,  
- Whose wood to coction yields a precious balm,  
- Specific in the flux: Endemial ail, [505]  
- Much cause have I to weep thy fatal sway.â€”  
- But God is just, and man must not repine.  
- Nor shall the ricinus unnoted pass;

> VER. 500. *Now children of this clime:*\] It is supposed that oranges, lemons, and limes were introduced into America by the Spaniards; but I am more inclined to believe they are natural to the climate. The Spaniards themselves probably had the two first from the Saracens, for the Spanish noun *Naranja*, whence the English word *Orange*, is plainly Arabic.  
> VER. 503. *the logwood-hedge.*\] Linnaeus's name for this useful tree is *Haemotoxylon*, but it is better known to physicians by that of *Lignum campechense*. Its virtues, as a medicine, and properties as an ingredient in dying, need not to be enumerated in this place. It makes a no less strong than beautiful hedge in the West-Indies, where it rises to a considerable height.  
> VER. 508. *Nor shall the ricinus*\] This shrub is commonly called the physic-nut. It is generally divided into three kinds, the common, the French, and the Spanish, which differ from each other in their leaves and flowers, if not in their fruit or seeds. The plant from which the castor-oil is extracted is also called *Ricinus*, though it has no resemblance to any of the former, in leaves, flowers, or seeds. In one particular they all agree, *viz*. in their yielding to coction or expression a purgative or emetic oil. The Spaniards name these nuts *Avellanas purgativas*; hence Ray terms them *Avellanae purgatrices novi orbis*. By roasting they are supposed to lose part of the virulency, which is wholly destroyed, say some people, by taking out a leaf-like substance that is to be found between the lobes. The nut exceeds a walnut, or even an almond, in sweetness, and yet three or four of them will operate briskly both up and down. The French call this useful shrub *Medecinier*. That species of it which bears red coral like flowers is named *Bellyach* by the Barbadians; and its ripe seeds are supposed to be specific against melancholy.
