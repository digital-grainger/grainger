- To tropic suns, to fell barbaric hinds,  
- A poor outcast, an alien, did he roam;  
- His wife, the partner of his better hours, [590]  
- And one sweet infant, chear'd his dismal way.  
- Unus'd to labour; yet the orient sun,  
- Yet western Phoebus, saw him wield the hoe.  
- At first a garden all his wants supplied,  
- \(For Temperance sat chearful at his board,\) [595]  
- With yams, cassada, and the food of strength,  
- Thrice-wholesome tanies: while a neighbouring dell,

> VER. 596. *cassada,*\] Cassavi, cassava, is called *Jatropha* by botanists. Its meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous. There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*. The colour of its root is white, like a parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the Indians prepare many wholesome dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and, being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob. Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The French name it *Manihot*, *Magnoc*, and *Manioc*, and the Spaniards *Mandiocha*. It is pretended that all creatures but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There is one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*.

> VER. 597. *tanies:*\] This wholesome root, in some of the islands, is called *Edda*: Its botanical name is *Arum maximum AEgyptiacum*. There are three species of tanies, the blue, the scratching, and that which is commonly roasted. The blossoms of all three are very fragrant, in a morning or evening. The young leaves, as well as the spiral stalks which support the flower, are eaten by Negroes as a salad. The root makes a good broth in dysenteric complaints. They are seldom so large as the yam, but most people think them preferable in point of taste.
