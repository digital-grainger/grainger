- When he presented, more nectarious deem'd.— [440]
- The sweetest sappadillas[^f78n1] oft he brought;
- From him more sweet ripe sappadillas seem'd.—
- Nor had long absence yet effac'd her form;
- Her charms still triumph'd o'er Britannia's fair.
- One morn he met her in Sheen's royal walks;[^f78n2] [445]
- Nor knew, till then, sweet Sheen contain'd his all.
- His taste mature approv'd his infant choice.
- In colour, form, expression, and in grace,
- She shone all perfect; while each pleasing art,
- And each soft virtue that the sex adorns, [450]
- Adorn'd the woman. My imperfect strain,
- Which Percy's[^f78n3] happier pencil would demand,
- Can ill describe the transports Junio felt
- At this discovery: He declar'd his love;
- She own'd his merit, nor refus'd his hand. [455]

- AND shall not Hymen[^f78n4] light his brightest torch,
- For this delighted pair? Ah, Junio knew,

> VER. 441. *sappadillas*\] This is a pleasant-tasted fruit, somewhat resembling a bergamot-pear, in shape and colour. The tree which produces it, is large and shady. Its leaves are of a shining green; but the flowers, which are monopetalous, are of a palish white. The fruit is coronated when ripe, and contains, in its pulp, several longish black seeds. It is wholesome. Antigua[^f78n5] produces the best sappadillas I ever tasted. The trivial name is Spanish. Botanists call it *Cainito*.

[^f78n1]: The sapodilla (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the nasebery or nispero, is a sour or tart fruit whose native range includes Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

[^f78n2]: Sheen is the old name for what is now the London borough of Richmond upon Thames. According to Gilmore, Sheen's royal walks probably refers to Richmond Park, a royal park. 

[^f78n3]: Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811). English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger, best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*. Furthermore, the *Reliques* contains a poem by Grainger entitled "Bryan and Pereene. A West-Indian Ballad," a tragic love story whose theme mirrors that of the story of Junio and Theana. 

[^f78n4]: Greek god of marriage.

[^f78n5]: One of the Leeward Islands; St. Kitts lies just to the west of it. Antigua was colonized by the English in 1632 and now forms part of the nation of Antigua and Barbuda.
