- When he presented, more nectarious deem'd.— [440]
- The sweetest sappadillas oft he brought;
- From him more sweet ripe sappadillas seem'd.—
- Nor had long absence yet effac'd her form;
- Her charms still triumph'd o'er Britannia's fair.
- One morn he met her in Sheen's royal walks; [445]
- Nor knew, till then, sweet Sheen contain'd his all.
- His taste mature approv'd his infant choice.
- In colour, form, expression, and in grace,
- She shone all perfect; while each pleasing art,
- And each soft virtue that the sex adorns, [450]
- Adorn'd the woman. My imperfect strain,
- Which Percy's happier pencil would demand,

- She own'd his merit, nor refus'd his hand. [455]

- AND shall not Hymen light his brightest torch,
- For this delighted pair? Ah, Junio knew,

> VER. 441. *sappadillas*\] This is a pleasant-tasted fruit, somewhat resembling a bergamot-pear, in shape and colour. The tree which produces it, is large and shady. Its leaves are of a shining green; but the flowers, which are monopetalous, are of a palish white. The fruit is coronated when ripe, and contains, in its pulp, several longish black seeds. It is wholesome. Antigua produces the best sappadillas I ever tasted. The trivial name is Spanish. Botanists call it *Cainito*.
