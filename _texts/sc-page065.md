[65]()

- Planter, prefer them now: the rattling shower, [190]
- Pour'd down in constant streams, for days and nights,
- Not only swells, with nectar sweet, thy Canes;
- But, in the deluge, drowns thy plundering foe. 

- WHEN may the planter idly fold his arms,
- And say, "My soul take rest?" Superior ills, [195]
- Ills which no care nor wisdom can avert,
- In black succession rise. Ye men of Kent,
- When nipping Eurus, with the brutal force
- Of Boreas, join'd in ruffian league, assail
- Your ripen'd hop-grounds; tell me what you feel, [200]
- And pity the poor planter; when the blast,
- Fell plague of Heaven! perdition of the isles!
- Attacks his waving gold. Tho' well-manur'd;
- A richness tho' thy fields from nature boast;
- Though seasons pour; this pestilence invades: [205]
- Too oft it seizes the glad infant-throng,
- Nor pities their green nonage: Their broad blades
- Of which the graceful wood-nymphs erst compos'd
- The greenest garlands to adorn their brows,

> VER. 205. *Tho' seasons*\] Without a rainy season, the Sugar-cane could not be cultivated to any advantage: For what Pliny the Elder writes of another plant may be applied to this, *Gaudet irriguis, et toto anno bibere amat*.

> VER. 205. *this pestilence*\] It must, however, be confessed, that the blast is less frequent in lands naturally rich, or such as are made so by well-rotted manure.
