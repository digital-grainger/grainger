[114]()

- I spurn indignant; toil a pleasure seems.[^f114n1] [500]
- For not Marne's[^f114n2] flowery banks, nor Tille's[^f114n3] green bounds,
- Where Ceres with the God of vintage reigns,
- In happiest union; not Vigornian[^f114n4] hills,
- Pomona's[^f114n5] lov'd abode, afford to man
- Goblets more priz'd, or laudable of taste, [505]
- To slake parch'd thirst, and mitigate the clime.

- YET, 'mid this blest ebriety,[^f114n6] some tears,
- For friends I left in Albion's[^f114n7] distant isle,
- For Johnson,[^f114n8] Percy,[^f114n9] White,[^f114n10] escape mine eyes:
- For her, fair Auth'ress! whom first Calpe's[^f114n11] rocks [510]
- A sportive infant saw; and whose green years
- True genius blest with her benignest gifts
- Of happiest fancy. O, were ye all here,
- O, were ye here; with him, my Paeon's[^f114n12] son!
- Long-known, of worth approv'd, thrice candid soul! [515]
- How would your converse charm the lonely hour?
- Your converse, where mild wisdom tempers mirth;
- And charity, the petulance of wit;

> VER. 501. *Marne's flowery banks, nor Tille's*\] Two rivers in France, along whose banks the best Burgundy and Champagne-grapes grow.

> VER. 510. *For her, fair Auth'ress!*\] Mrs. Lennox.[^f114n13]

[^f114n1]: The theme of pleasurable labor is central to the georgic. Here, Grainger's narrator experiences labor as pleasurable after he has drunk rum, which is an end product of enslaved labor.

[^f114n2]: French tributary of the Seine that flows through the Champagne region in northeastern France. Wines have been made there since the Roman era, but most champagnes were still wines until the mid-nineteenth century, when sparkling wines became popular.

[^f114n3]: A river in Burgundy, a major wine-producing region in France.

[^f114n4]: Vigornian is the Latin name for Worcester, a center of cider production in England.

[^f114n5]: Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit.

[^f114n6]: State or habit of being intoxicated, drunk.

[^f114n7]: Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.  

[^f114n8]: Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), one of the most important English writers of the eighteenth century. Works include a *Dictionary* (1755) of the English language, *Rasselas* (1759), *A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland* (1775), and *The Lives of the Poets* (1779-1781). Johnson also was a prolific essayist, publishing a series of 208 essays entitled *The Rambler* (1750-1752). Johnson reviewed *The Sugar-Cane* in the *London Chronicle* (Jul 1764) and the *Critical Review* (Oct 1764). What Johnson actually thought of Grainger's poem is unclear. While both of his published reviews of the poem are largely positive, the later one in the *Critical Review* contains a rebuke of Grainger's depiction of the slave trade. For Johnson's rebuke, see the note for lines 72-118 in Book IV (the lines that Johnson objected to).  

[^f114n9]: Bishop Thomas Percy (1729-1811). English cleric, writer, and translator. A friend and frequent correspondent of Grainger, best known for the *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry* (1765), published by James and Richard Dodsley, who also published *The Sugar-Cane*.

[^f114n10]: The identity of White was confusing to eighteenth-century readers. In a letter dated 9 May 1801, written to Thomas Percy by his friend Robert Anderson, the latter states that "[s]everal passages [in Grainger's poem] want illustration, which probably you can give," and he then asks, "Who is 'White'?" In his reply, Percy clarifies, "White, was Mr. James White a native of Edinburgh, who resided in London and taught the learned Languages viz. Latin and Greek to Grown Gentlemen whose Education had been neglected." Percy adds that White authored a translation of Aristophanes' *The Clouds* (1759) and a grammatical text entitled *The English Verb* (1761). White died circa 1811. See *The Percy Letters* 9.59, 9.67-68, 9.269.

[^f114n11]: Calpe refers to one of the Pillars of Hercules in Greek mythology, now known as the Rock of Gibraltar. 

[^f114n12]: Paeon, the Greek god of healing, also known as Paean. 

[^f114n13]: Charlotte Lennox (1730/1731?-1804), British writer best known for the novel *The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella* (1752). A close friend of Samuel Johnson.
