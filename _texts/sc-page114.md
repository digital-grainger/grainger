[123]()

- I spurn indignant, toil a pleasure seems. [500]
- For not Marne's flowery banks, nor Tille's green bounds,
- Where Ceres with the god of vintage reigns,
- In happiest union, not Vigornian hills,
- Pomona's lov'd abode, afford to an
- Goblets more priz'd, or laudable of taste, [505]
- To slake parch'd thirst, and mitigate the clime.

- YET, 'mid this blest ebriety, some tears,
- For friends I left in Albion's distant isle,
- For Johnson, Percy, White, escape mine eyes:
- For her, fair Auth'ress! whom first Calpe's rocks [510]
- A sportive infant saw; and whose green years
- True genius blest with her benignest gifts
- Of happiest fancy. O, were ye all here,
- O, were ye here; with him, my Paeon's son!
- Long-known, of worth approv'd, thrice candid soul! [515]
- How would your converse charm the lonely hour?
- Your converse, where mild wisdom tempers mirth;
- And charity, the petulance of wit;
