[31]()  

- WHILE Procyon reigns yet fervid in the sky;  
- While yet the fiery Sun in Leo rides;  
- And the Sun's child, the mail'd anana, yields  
- His regal apple to the ravish'd taste;  
- And thou green avocato, charm of sense, [420]  
- Thy ripened marrow liberally bestow'st;  
- Begin the distant mountain-land to plant:  
- So shall thy Canes defy November's cold,  
- Ungenial to the upland young; so best,  
- Unstinted by the arrow's deadening power, [425]  
- Long yellow joints shall flow with generous juice.  

- BUT, till the lemon, orange, and the lime,  
- Amid their verdant umbrage, countless glow  
- With fragrant fruit of vegetable gold;  
- 'Till yellow plantanes bend the unstain'd bough [430]  
- With crooked clusters, prodigally full;  
- 'Till Capricorn command the cloudy sky;  
- And moist Aquarius melt in daily showers,

> VER. 418. *the mail'd anana*\] This is the pine-apple, and needs no description; the cherimoya, a South-American fruit, is by all, who have tasted both, allowed to surpass the pine, and is even said to be more wholesome. The botanical name of the pine-apple is *bromelia*. Of the wild pine-apple, or ananas bravo, hedges are made in South-America. It produces an inferior sort of fruit.
