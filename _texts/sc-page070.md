- Thy doors and windows guard; securely lodge
- Thy stocks and mill-points.â€”Then, or calms obtain;
- Breathless the royal palm-tree's airiest van;
- While, o'er the panting isle, the daemon Head [295]
- High hurls his flaming brand; vast, distant waves
- The main drives furious in, and heaps the shore
- With strange productions: Or, the blue serene
- Assumes a louring aspect, as the clouds
- Fly, wild-careering, thro' the vault of heaven; [300]
- Then transient birds, of various kinds, frequent
- Each stagnant pool; some hover o'er thy roof;
- Then Eurus reigns no more; but each bold wind,
- By turns, usurps the empire of the air
- With quick inconstancy; [305]
- Thy herds, as sapient of the coming storm,
- (for beasts partake some portion of the sky,)
- In troops associate; and, in cold sweats bath'd,
- Wild-bellowing, eye the pole. Ye seamen, now,
- Ply to the southweard, if the changeful moon, [310]
- Or, in her interlunar palace hid,
