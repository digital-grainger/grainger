[157]()

- Nor gently sloping side of breezy hill,
- Nor streets, at distance due, imbower'd in trees;
- Will half the health, or half the pleasure yield,
- Unless some pitying naiad[^f157n1] deign to lave, [580]
- With an unceasing stream, thy thirsty bounds.

- ON festal days; or when their work is done; 
- Permit thy slaves to lead the choral dance,
- To the wild banshaw's melancholy sound.[^f157n2]
- Responsive to the sound, head feet and frame [585]
- Move aukwardly harmonious; hand in hand
- Now lock'd, the gay troop circularly wheels,
- And frisks and capers with intemperate joy.
- Halts the vast circle, all clap hands and sing;
- While those distinguish'd for their heels and air, [590]
- Bound in the center, and fantastic twine.
- Meanwhile some stripling, from the choral ring,
- Trips forth; and, not ungallantly, bestows
- On her who nimblest hath the greensward[^f157n3] beat,
- And whose flush'd beauties have inthrall'd his soul, [595]
- A silver token of his fond applause.


> VER. 584. *banshaw*\] This is a sort of rude guitar, invented by the Negroes. It produces a wild pleasing melancholy sound. 


[^f157n1]: A nymph of springs, rivers, and lakes in Greek mythology. 

[^f157n2]: This stanza describes the dances that the enslaved participated in on days of rest and holidays. The banshaw is another name for the banjo, an instrument that originated in Africa and arrived with the enslaved in the Americas. There, it evolved, as did the music played on it, to become an integral part of Afro-Caribbean and African American musical cultures. European colonists in the early Caribbean were fascinated both by the banjo and the music and dancing of the enslaved. For example, Hans Sloane (1660-1753), a physician and naturalist who visited Jamaica in the seventeenth century, got someone to transcribe some of the songs that he heard. He included these transcriptions in *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). These songs can be heard at www.musicalpassage.org, a site created by Laurent Dubois, David K. Garner, Mary Caton Lingold, and others. Although colonists may have understood the dances and music as entertainment, Dubois and others have argued that dance and music helped the enslaved create spaces of autonomy for themselves, as they moved and created sounds that hearkened back to the performance traditions of Africa.

[^f157n3]: Grass-covered ground, turf.
