[157]()

- Nor gently sloping side of breezy hill,
- Nor streets, at distance due, imbower'd in trees;
- Will half the health, or half the pleasure yield,
- Unless some pitying naiad deign to lave [580]
- With an unceasing stream, thy thirsty bounds.

- ON festal days; or when their work is done; 
- Permit thy slaves to lead the choral dance,
- To the wild banshaw's melancholy sound.
- Responsive to the sound, head feet and frame [585]
- Move aukwardly harmonious; hand in hand
- Now lock'd, the gay troop circularly wheels,
- And frisks and capers with intemperate joy.
- Halts the vast circle, all clap hands and sing;
- While those distinguish'd for their heels and air, [590]
- Bound in the center, and fantastic twine.
- Meanwhile some stripling, from the choral ring,
- Trips forth; and, not ungallantly, bestows
- On her who nimblest hath the greensward beat,
- And whose flush'd beauties have inthrall'd his soul, [595]
- A silver token of his fond applause.
