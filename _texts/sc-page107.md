[107]()

- In silence lock it, sudden, and constrain'd,
- \(Death to Xantippe,\) with distorting pain.

- NOR is it not effectual: But wouldst thou [360]
- Have rival brokers for thy cades contend;
- Superior arts remain.â€”Small casks provide,
- Replete with lime-stone thoroughly calcin'd,
- And from the air secur'd: This Bristol sends,
- Bristol, Britannia's second mart and eye! [365]

- NOR "to thy waters only trust for fame,"
- Bristol; nor to thy beamy diamonds trust:
- Tho' these oft deck Britannia's lovely fair;
- And those oft save the guardians of her realm.
- Thy marble-quarries claim the voice of praise, [370]
- Which rich incrusts thy Avon's banks, sweet banks!
- Tho' not to you young Shakespear, Fancy's child,
- Ail-rudely warbled his first woodland notes;
- Tho, not your caves, while terror stalk'd around,
- Saw him essay to clutch the ideal sword, [375]
- With drops of blood distain'd: yet, lovely banks,
- On you reclin'd, another tun'd his pipe;
- Whom all the Muses emulously love,
