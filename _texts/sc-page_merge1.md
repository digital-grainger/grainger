## THE SUGAR-CANE.

### BOOK I.


- WHAT soil the Cane affects; what care demands;
- Beneath what signs to plant;[^f3n1] what ills await;
- How the hot nectar best to christallize;
- And Afric’s sable progeny to treat:[^f3n2]
- A Muse, that long hath wander’d in the groves [5]
- Of myrtle-indolence, attempts to sing.[^f3n3]

- SPIRIT of Inspiration, that did'st lead 
- Th’ Ascrean Poet to the sacred Mount,[^f3n4]
- And taught’st him all the precepts of the swain;[^f3n5]
- Descend from Heaven, and guide my trembling steps [10] 
- To Fame’s eternal Dome, where Maro[^f3n6] reigns;
- Where pastoral Dyer, where Pomona’s Bard,
- And Smart and Sommerville in varying strains,[^f3n7]

[^f3n1]: Planting by the signs, also known as agricultural astrology, is a cultivation method that advises planting and harvesting crops based on moon phases and the astrological calendar.

[^f3n2]: The first four lines of the poem summarize the topics Grainger addresses in the four books of the poem. Book I introduces the reader to sugar cane and its cultivation; Book II concerns potential problems planters face in cultivating cane; Book III discusses the process of turning sugar cane into the final product of crystallized sugar; and Book IV deals with the management and treatment of enslaved laborers.    

[^f3n3]: Myrtle (*Myrtus communis*) is an aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love. Rather than a traditional invocation of the muse, *The Sugar-Cane* begins with a muse who has been wandering and in love. Indeed, Grainger married Daniel Matthew Burt, whom he met during his transatlantic voyage to St. Kitts and who was the daughter of one of the most prominent planter families of the island, in 1759. Their daughter Louise was born before he began composing the poem.

[^f3n4]: The Ascrean poet is Hesiod (c. 700 BCE), who was from the Greek village of Ascra in the Valley of the Muses on the eastern slope of Mt. Helicon (the sacred Mount). Contemporary of Homer and known for the *Theogony* and *Works and Days*, which is considered to have influenced Virgil's *Georgics*.  

[^f3n5]: A country or farm laborer, a shepherd. A key figure in georgic poetry.  

[^f3n6]: Maro is Virgil or Publius Vergilius Maro (70-19 BCE), author of the *Eclogues*, the *Aeneid*, and the *Georgics*. A major influence on Grainger and other neo-georgic poets of the eighteenth century.

[^f3n7]: Grainger is listing other eighteenth-century authors of georgic poems. Dyer is John Dyer (1699-1757), a Welsh painter and poet and author of *The Fleece* (1757), which Grainger reviewed in the *Monthly Review* (April 1757). Pomona's Bard is John Philips (1676-1709), an English poet and author of the *Cyder* (1708). Pomona is the Roman goddess of fruit. Smart is Christopher Smart (1722-1771), an English poet and author of *The Hop-Garden* (1752). Sommerville is William Somerville (1675-1742), an English poet and author of *The Chace* (1735).

- Their sylvan lore convey: O may I join 
- This choral band, and from their precepts learn [15]
- To deck my theme, which though to song unknown,
- Is most momentous to my Country’s weal![^f4n1]

- SO shall my numbers win the Public ear;
- And not displease Aurelius;[^f4n2] him to whom,
- Imperial George, the monarch of the main,[^f4n3] [20]
- Hath given to wield the scepter of those isles,
- Where first the Muse beheld the spiry Cane,
- Supreme of plants, rich subject of my song.


> VER. 22. *the spiry Cane,*\] The botanical name of the Cane is *Saccharum*. The Greeks and Romans seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful plant. Lucan and Pliny are the only Authors among the former who mention it; and, so far as I can find, Arrian is the only Greek.[^f4n4] The first of these Writers, in enumerating Pompey’s Eastern auxiliaries,[^f4n5] describes a nation who made use of the Cane-juice as a drink:      

>   *Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos.*

> The industrious Naturalist says, *Saccharum et Arabia fert, sed laudatius India*; and the Greek Historian, in his *&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#987;* of the Red-sea, tells us of a neighbouring nation who drank it also; his words are, *&#956;&#949;&#955;&#953; &#964;&#959; &#967;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#967;&#935;&#945;&#961;&#953;*. The Cane, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably cultivated there time immemorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of; they afterwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the etymology, for the Arabic word &#1505;&#1499;&#1512; is evidently derived from the Hebrew &#1513;&#1499;&#1512;, which signifies an *intoxicating liquor*. When the Indians began to make the Cane-juice into sugar, I cannot discover;[^f4n6] probably, it soon found its way into Europe in that form, first by the Red-sea, and afterwards through Persia, by the Black-sea and Caspian; but the plant itself was not known to Europe, till the Arabians introduced it into the southern parts of Spain, Sicily, and those provinces of France which bor-  

[^f4n1]: Well-being, happiness, prosperity.  

[^f4n2]: Gilmore identifies Aurelius as George Thomas (c. 1694-1774), who was born to a planter family on the island of Antigua. Descended on his mother's side from Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop, Thomas was a member of the Antiguan colonial assembly before being named Governor of Pennsylvania (1738-1747). He was Governor of the Leeward Islands from 1753 to 1766.

[^f4n3]: George III (1738-1820) was king of Britain from 1760 to 1820. The main is the ocean.  

[^f4n4]: Lucan or Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (39-65 CE) was the nephew of Seneca the younger and the author of *The Civil War*. Gaius Plinius Secondus or Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) was the author of *Historia Naturalis*. Arrian or Lucius Flavius Arrianus (86-160 CE) was the author of various short essays and histories, including *Bithyniaca*, *Parthica*, and what is known as *Affairs of Alexander*.

[^f4n5]: Pompey or Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106-48 BCE) was a member of the First Triumvirate. He defeated Mithridates, King of Pontus, and established military order in the eastern provinces of the Roman empire.

[^f4n6]: In this note, Grainger traces the movement of sugar cane from India to the Americas. Sugar cane (*Saccharum officinarum*) is most likely native to New Guinea, where it was first cultivated thousands of years ago and from where it began to be dispersed by human migrants around 8000 BCE. By the fourth to sixth centuries CE, sugar cane was being refined into crystallized sugar in India and Persia. From there, sugar cane and knowledge of sugar cultivation, processing, and refining traveled to the Mediterranean. The Spanish then transplanted sugar to the Americas and established plantations there (Columbus first brought sugar to the Caribbean in 1493).

> der on the Pyrenean mountains. It was also successfully cultivated in Egypt, and in many places on the Barbary-coast.[^f5n2] From the Mediterranean, the Spaniards and Portuguese transported the Cane to the Azores, the Madeiras, the Canary and the Cape-Verd islands, soon after they had been discovered in the fifteenth century: and, in most of these, particularly Madeira, it throve exceedingly.[^f5n3] Whether the Cane is a native of either the Great or Lesser Antilles[^f5n4] cannot now be determined, for their discoverers were so wholly employed in searching after imaginary gold-mines, that they took little or no notice of the natural productions. Indeed the wars, wherein they wantonly engaged themselves with the natives, was another hindrance to physical investigation. But whether the Cane was a production of the West-Indies or not, it is probable, the Spaniards and Portuguese did not begin to cultivate it either there or in South America (where it certainly was found), till some years after their discovery. It is also equally uncertain whether Sugar was first made in the Islands or on the Continent, and whether the Spaniards or Portuguese were the first planters in the new world: it is indeed most likely that the latter erected the first sugar-works in Brazil, as they are more lively and enterprizing than the Spaniards. However they had not long the start of the latter; for, in 1506, Ferdinand the Catholic[^f5n5] ordered the Cane to be carried from the Canaries to St. Domingo,[^f5n6] in which island one Pedro de Atenca soon after built an *Ingenio de açucar*, for so the Spaniards call a Sugar-work. But, though they began thus early to turn their thoughts to sugar, the Portuguese far outstripped them in that trade; for Lisbon soon supplied most of Europe with that commodity; and, notwithstanding the English then paid the Portuguese at the rate of 4 *l. per C.* wt.[^f5n7] for muscovado,[^f5n8] yet that price, great as it may now appear, was probably much less than what the Sugar from the East-Indies[^f5n9] had commonly been sold for. Indeed, so intent was the Crown of Portugal on extending their Brazil-trade, that that of the East-Indies began to be neglected, and soon after suffered a manifest decay. However, their sugar made them ample amends, in which trade they continued almost without a rival for upwards of a century. At last the Dutch, in 1623, drove the Portuguese out of all the northern part of Brazil; and, during the one and twenty years they kept that conquest, those industrious republicans learned the art of making sugar. This probably inspired the English with a desire

[^f5n1]: As sugar cane grows, it forms segments called joints. Grainger is thus referring here to the growth of sugar cane.  

[^f5n2]: Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that runs from modern Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean and includes parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. 

[^f5n3]: The Azores, Madeiras, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde Islands are groups of islands in the eastern Atlantic Ocean relatively close to the coasts of Europe and Africa. They often served as waystations for Europeans voyaging from Europe or Africa to the Americas. As Grainger remarks, sugar cane was introduced by the Spanish and Portuguese to these islands in the fifteenth century. The sugar plantations that were established there became models for the ones that were subsequently established in the Caribbean.  

[^f5n4]: Antilles refers to the islands of the Caribbean and is often used as a substitute for West Indies. The Greater Antilles are the large islands on the northwest end of the archipelago (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico).  The Lesser Antilles (further split into the Windward and Leeward Islands) are the islands ranging from the Virgin Islands in the north to Grenada in the south. St. Kitts is one of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.

[^f5n5]: King Ferdinand V of Castile and León and II of Aragon (1452-1516), husband of Queen Isabella of Castille and patron with Isabella of Columbus' 1492 voyage.  

[^f5n6]: Hispaniola, the island that includes the modern nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

[^f5n7]: Four pounds per hundredweight. A hundredweight (equivalent to 112 lbs) was a standard measure for commerce. £4 had the purchasing power of approximately forty days of wages for a skilled tradesman (see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/).

[^f5n8]:  A dark brown, unrefined sugar that was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. Often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Britain and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.

[^f5n9]: The whole of Southeast Asia to the east of and including India.

> of coming in for a share of the sugar-trade; accordingly they, renouncing their chimerical search after gold mines in Florida and Guiana,[^f6n3] settled themselves soon after at the mouth of the river Surinam, where they cultivated the Cane with such success, that when the colony was ceded to the Dutch by the treaty of Breda,[^f6n4] it maintained not less than 40,000 Whites, half that number of slaves, and employed one year with another 15,000 ton of shipping. This cession was a severe blow to the English-trade, which it did not recover for several years, though many of the Surinam Planters carried their art and Negroes to the Leeward Islands[^f6n5] and Jamaica, which then began to be the object of political consideration in England.  

> Sugar is twice mentioned by Chaucer,[^f6n6] who flourished in the fourteenth century; and succeeding poets, down to the middle of the last, use the epithet *Sugar'd*, whenever they would express any thing uncommonly pleasing: since that time, the more elegant writers seldom admit of that adjective in a metaphorical sense; but herein perhaps they are affectedly squeamish. 

> VER. 29. *Muscovado,*\] The Cane-juice being brought to the consistence of syrup, and, by subsequent coction,[^f6n7] granulated, is then called *muscovado* (a Spanish word probably, though not to be found in Pineda[^f6n8]) vulgarly brown Sugar; the French term it *sucre brut*.

> VER. 34. *wild red Cedar*\] There are two species of Cedar commonly to be met with in the West-Indies, the white and red, which differ from the cedars cultivated in the Bermudas:[^f6n9] both are lofty, shady, and of quick growth. The white succeeds in any soil, and produces a flower which, infused like tea, is useful against fish poison.[^f6n10] The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain. The wood of both are highly useful for many mechanical purposes, and but too little planted.

> VER. 34. *Locust*\] This is also a lofty tree. It is of quick growth and handsome, and produces a not disagreeable fruit in a flat pod or legumen, about three inches long. It is a serviceable wood. In botanical books, I find three different names for the locust-tree; that meant here is the *Siliqua edulis*.

[^f6n1]: Although Grainger calls muscovado silvery grey, it was actually a dark brown sugar. Muscovado was typically the end product of the sugar-making process in the Caribbean. It was often described as unrefined since it was usually processed further in Britain and lightened in color before being sold to consumers.

[^f6n2]: The wild red cedar is *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. It is now considered vulnerable to extinction due to unsustainable levels of harvesting. The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.

[^f6n3]: Aggregate name for the colonies located along the northern coast of South America between the mouth of the Orinoco River (in modern Venezuela) and the mouth of the Amazon (in Brazil). Also included parts of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Colonizers included Portugal, France, the Netherlands, England, and Spain.

[^f6n4]: The treaty of Breda (1667) concluded the Anglo-Dutch War between England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark. The treaty formalized a major reorganization of colonial power, with the English taking control of New York, New Jersey, Antigua, and Montserrat; the Dutch gaining control of Surinam; and the French reclaiming Acadia in Atlantic Canada. Significantly for *The Sugar-Cane*, the treaty restored the French and British partition of St. Kitts.

[^f6n5]: Leeward is a nautical term meaning sheltered from the wind (i.e., downwind). The Leeward Islands include the British and US Virgin Islands, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barthélemy, Barbuda, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Dominica.

[^f6n6]: Geoffrey Chaucer (1340-1400), author of *The Canterbury Tales*. Gilmore notes that Chaucer uses sugar twice in *The Canterbury Tales* and again in *Troilus and Criseyde*.

[^f6n7]: Boiling, cooking. 

[^f6n8]: Pineda is Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñá (1607-1680), author of *Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile* (finished 1672).  

[^f6n9]: The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean. The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*) is native to Bermuda and was used by early colonists as building material and fuel. By the 1830s, the ship-building industry had denuded Bermuda of most of its indigenous cedars. It is still a critically endangered species.  

[^f6n10]: By fish poison, Grainger is probably referring to ciguatera, a disease long associated with the consumption of predatory fish in the Caribbean. Ciguatera is a toxin produced by a marine microalgae called *Gambierdiscus toxicus*, and, like mercury, it becomes more concentrated in fish as they rise in the food chain. Symptoms of ciguatera include nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years.

- Nor let his nectar, nor his silken pods, [35]
- The sweet-smell'd cassia, or vast ceiba save.[^f7n1]
- Yet spare the guava, yet the guaiac spare;[^f7n2]
- A wholesome food the ripened guava yields,
- Boast of the housewife; while the guaiac grows
- A sovereign antidote, in wood, bark, gum, [40]
- To cause the lame his useless crutch forego,
- And dry the sources of corrupted love.
- Nor let thy bright impatient flames destroy

>VER. 36. *or vast ceiba save.*\] Canoes have been scooped out of this tree, capable of holding upwards of a hundred people; and many hundreds, as authors relate, have been at once sheltered by its shade. Its pods contain a very soft short cotton, like silk: hence the English call the tree the Silk-cotton-tree; and the Spaniards name its cotton *Lana de ceiba*. It has been wrought into stockings; but its commonest use is to stuff pillows and mattrasses. It might be made an article of commerce, as the tree grows without trouble, and is yearly covered with pods. An infusion of the leaves is a gentle diaphoretic,[^f7n3] and much recommended in the small-pox. The botanical name of the ceiba is *Bombax*; and the French call it *Fromager*. There are two species; the stem of the one being prickly, and that of the other smooth.

>VER. 37. *Yet spare the guava,*\] The Spaniards call this tree *guayava*. It bears a fruit as large, and of much the same shape as a golden pippen. This is of three species, the yellow, the amazon, and the white; the last is the most delicate, but the second sort the largest: All are equally wholesome, when stewed or made into jelly, or marmalade. When raw, they are supposed to generate worms.[^f7n4] Strangers do not always at first like their flavour, which is peculiarly strong. This, however, goes off by use, and they become exceedingly agreeable. Acosta says the Peruvian guavas surpass those of any other part of America.[^f7n5] The bark of the tree is an astringent, and tanns leather as well as that of oak. The French call the tree *Goyavier*.

> VER. 37. —*yet the guaiac spare;*\] The lignum-vitae, or pockwood-tree. The virtues of every part of this truly medical tree are too well known to be enumerated here. The hardness and incorruptibility of its timber make abundant amends for the great slowness of its growth, for of it are formed the best posts for houses against hurricanes, and it is no less usefully employed in building wind-mills and cattle-mills.

[^f7n1]: Cassia is probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka. Ceiba is the kapok or silk-cotton tree (*Ceiba pentandra*). The ceiba, whose native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas, can achieve a height of fifty meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds.

[^f7n2]: The guava is a fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, which is probably native to Central and South America but was naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century. Guaiac refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. It also was widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.

[^f7n3]: Having the property of inducing or promoting perspiration.

[^f7n4]: Grainger is referring to parasitic worms (helminths) that live in the digestive tracts of humans and other animals. There are many such parasites, including tapeworms and roundworms. Worms were a major health concern in the eighteenth century, producing such physical effects as malnutrition and anemia, as well as cognitive problems.

[^f7n5]: Acosta is José de Acosta (1539-1600), a Jesuit theologian, philosopher, and missionary who traveled to and spent several years in Peru and Mexico. Chiefly known for his *Historia natural y moral de las Indias* (1590), one of the earliest and most comprehensive surveys of the Americas.

- The golden shaddoc, the forbidden fruit,[^f8n1]
- The white acajou, and rich sabbaca:[^f8n2] [45]
- For, where these trees their leafy banners raise
- Aloft in air, a grey deep earth abounds,
- Fat, light; yet, when it feels the wounding hoe,

- In this the soul of vegetation wakes, 
- Pleas'd at the planter's call, to burst on day.

- THRICE happy he, to whom such fields are given!
- For him the Cane with little labour grows;

> VER. 44. *The golden shaddoc,*\] This is the largest and finest kind of orange. It is not a native of America, but was brought to the islands, from the East-Indies, by an Englishman, whose name it bears. It is of three kinds, the sweet, the sour, and the bitter; the juice of all of them is wholesome, and the rind medical. In flavour and wholesomeness, the sweet shaddoc excels the other two, and indeed every other kind of orange, except the forbidden fruit, which scarce yields to any known fruit in the four quarters of the world. 

> VER. 45. *sabbaca:*\] This is the Indian name of the avocato, avocado, avigato, or, as the English corruptly call it, alligator-pear. The Spaniards in South-America name it *aguacate*, and under that name it is described by Ulloa.[^f8n3] However, in Peru and Mexico, it is better known by the appellation of *palta* or *palto*. It is a sightly tree, of two species; the one bearing a green fruit, which is the most delicate, and the other a red, which is less esteemed, and grows chiefly in Mexico.[^f8n4] When ripe, the skin peels easily off, and discovers a butyraceous,[^f8n5] or rather a marrowy like substance, with greenish veins interspersed. Being eat with salt and pepper, or sugar and lime-juice, it is not only agreeable, but highly nourishing; hence Sir Hans Sloane[^f8n6] used to stile it Vegetable marrow. The fruit is of the size and shape of the pear named Lady's-thighs,[^f8n7] and contains a large stone, from whence the tree is propagated. These trees bear fruit but once a year. Few strangers care for it; but, by use, soon become fond of it. The juice of the kernel marks linen with a violet-colour. Its wood is soft, and consequently of little use. The French call it *Bois d'anise*,[^f8n8] and the tree *Avocat*: the botanical name is *Persea*.

[^f8n1]: The shaddock and forbidden fruit are two kinds of citrus. The shaddock (*Citrus maxima*) is also known as the pomelo or pummelo. It is native to Southeast Asia and was known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by an Englishman named Captain Shaddock. The forbidden fruit refers to species of citrus that are now virtually extinct. It is similar in taste to the orange and the shaddock, and it is closely related to the grapefruit (Higman 180).

[^f8n2]: Acajou refers to the cashew or cashewnut tree (*Anacardium occidentale*). Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. The fruit is caustic and was supposedly used by women in the eighteenth-century Caribbean as a chemical peel to remove freckles (Riddell 82-83; also see Grainger's note in Book IV, p. 132). Sabbaca refers to avocado (*Persea americana*), which probably originated in Central America. It then spread to the Caribbean in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Avocado was an important part of the diets of the enslaved who had access to it: they harvested it from woodlands, versus growing it in provision grounds or gardens (Higman 158-160).

[^f8n3]: Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Giral (1716-1795) was a colonel and naval officer of the Spanish navy, as well as an explorer and scientist. He participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).

[^f8n4]: There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.

[^f8n5]: Of the nature of butter; buttery.

[^f8n6]: Hans Sloane (1660-1753) was an Irish physician, naturalist, and collector who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 with Christopher Monck, second duke of Albemarle and newly appointed governor of Jamaica. During his stay in Jamaica, Sloane amassed an extensive collection of natural specimens, including plants, that later served as the basis for his natural history, *A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725). Sloane also succeeded Isaac Newton as president of the Royal Society in 1727. Upon his death, he bequeathed his extensive collections, which he had made considerable additions to after returning from Jamaica, to the British nation. These served as the founding collections of the British Museum, the British Library, and the Natural History Museum in London.

[^f8n7]: Grainger refers here to a pear known today as the jargonelle pear (*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'). It is one of the oldest pears in cultivation.

[^f8n8]: Anise wood. The leaves of some varieties of avocado give off a scent of anise when crushed.

> lies in seventeenth degree N. L.[^f9n6] It was discovered by the great Christopher Columbus,[^f9n7] in his second voyage, 1493, who was so pleased with its appearance, that he honoured it with his Christian name. Though others pretend, that appellation was given it from an imaginary resemblance between a high mountain in its centre, now called Mount Misery, to the fabulous legend of the Devil's carrying St. Christopher on his shoulders.[^f9n8] But, be this as it will, the Spaniards soon after settled it, and lived in tolerable harmony with the natives for many years; and, as their fleets commonly called in there to and from America for provision and water, the settlers, no doubt, reaped some advantage from their situation. By Templeman's Survey,[^f9n9] it contains eighty square miles, and is about seventy miles in circumference. It is of an irregular oblong figure, and has a chain of mountains, that run South and North almost from the one end of it to the other, formerly covered with wood, but now the Cane-plantations reach almost to their summits, and extend all the way, down their easy declining sides, to the sea. From these mountains some rivers take their rise, which never dry up; and there are many others which, after rain, run into the sea, but which, at other times, are lost before they reach it. Hence, as this island consists of mountain-land and valley, it must always make a midling crop; for when the low grounds fail, the uplands supply that deficiency; and, when the mountain canes are lodged (or become watery from too much rain) those in the plains yield surprisingly. Nor are the plantations here only seasonable, their Sugar sells for more than the Sugar of any other of his Majesty's islands; as

[^f9n1]: The dog star is another name for Sirius, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major. Sirius rises in conjunction with the sun from July 3 to August 11, which are known as the "dog days" of summer.

[^f9n2]: Sugar cane turns yellow when it is ripe.

[^f9n3]: Gilmore defines after-offspring as second-growth cane that sprouts from the stumps once first-growth stalks have been cut and harvested (also known as "ratoon canes").

[^f9n4]: Tempé is the name of a valley in Thessaly located between Mounts Olympus and Ossa; it also can be used as a general name for a beautiful valley or rural spot. In Greek mythology, Pan is god of flocks and herds and is usually represented with the horns, ears, and legs of a goat on the body of a man. Pan lived in Arcadia, an idealized, utopian place in mythology and literature.  

[^f9n5]: John of Gaunt describes England as "A precious stone, set in the silver sea" in Shakespeare's *Richard II* (2.1.46).

[^f9n6]: Seventeenth north latitude, one of the coordinates for St. Kitts.

[^f9n7]: Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), a Genoese-born explorer. The purpose of his famed 1492 voyage was to discover a western route to Asia. He set sight on the island of Guanahani (in the Bahamas) on October 12. Columbus completed four voyages to the Americas during his lifetime. 

[^f9n8]: Grainger may be referring to the legend that St. Christopher, whose name means "Christ carrier," once carried Jesus in the form of a child across a river. Mount Misery was the name used by Europeans for the main volcanic mountain on St. Kitts. It was renamed Mt. Liamuiga when St. Kitts and Nevis became independent.  

[^f9n9]: Grainger is referring to Thomas Templeman's *A New Survey of the Globe: Or, an Accurate Mensuration of all the...Countries...in the World* (1729).

> their produce cannot be refined to the best advantage, without a mixture of St. Kitts' muscovado. In the barren part of the island, which runs out towards Nevis,[^f10n2] are several ponds, which in dry weather crystallize into good salt; and below Mount Misery is a small Solfaterre and collection of fresh water, where fugitive Negroes often take shelter, and escape their pursuers.[^f10n3] Not far below is a large plain which affords good pasture, water, and wood; and, if the approaches thereto were fortified, which might be done at a moderate expence, it would be rendered inaccessible. The English, repulsing the few natives and Spaniards, who opposed them, began to plant tobacco here *A.D.* 1623. Two years after, the French landed in St. Christopher on the same day that the English-settlers received a considerable reinforcement from their mother-country; and, the chiefs of both nations, being men of sound policy, entered into an agreement to divide the island between them: the French retaining both extremities, and the English possessing themselves of the middle parts of the island. Some time after both nations erected sugar-works, but there were more tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton-plantations, than Sugar ones, as these require a much greater fund to carry them on, than those other.[^f10n4] All the planters, however, lived easy in their circumstances; for, though the Spaniards, who could not bear to be spectators of their thriving condition, did repossess themselves of the island, yet they were soon obliged to retire, and the colony succeeded better than ever. One reason for this was, that it had been agreed between the two nations, that they should here remain neutral whatever wars their mother-countries might wage against each other in Europe. This was a wise regulation for an infant settlement; but, when King James abdicated the British throne, the French suddenly rose, and drove out the unprepared English by force of arms.[^f10n5] The French colonists of St. Christopher had soon reason, however, to repent their impolitic breach of faith; for the expelled planters, being assisted by their countrymen from the neighbouring isles, and supported by a formidable fleet, soon recovered, not only their lost plantations, but obliged the French totally to abandon the island. After the treaty of Ryswick,[^f10n6] indeed, some few of those among them, who had not obtained settlements in Martinico[^f10n7] and Hispaniola, returned to St. Christopher: but the war of partition soon after breaking out, they were finally expelled, and the whole island was ceded in Sovereignty to the crown of Great Britain, by the treaty of Utrecht.[^f10n8] Since that time, St. Christopher has gradually improved, and it is now at the height of perfection. The Indian name of St. Christopher is *Liamuiga*, or the Fertile Island.

[^f10n1]: City and province in central Sicily.

[^f10n2]: Together, these islands form the modern Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.

[^f10n3]: Grainger refers here to enslaved persons running away from plantations and taking advantage of the rough terrain near Mt. Liamuiga to evade re-capture. A solfaterre is a volcano.  

[^f10n4]: Tobacco, indigo, coffee, and cotton were major agricultural commodities in the eighteenth-century Caribbean. Tobacco (*Nicotiana tabacum*) is native to the Americas. Indigo (genus *Indigofera*) is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[^f10n5]: King James was King James II of England and Ireland and James VII of Scotland (1633–1701). Son of Charles I, James II became king of England after the death of his brother, Charles II. He was the last Roman Catholic king of England and abdicated in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. 

[^f10n6]: Also Treaty of Rijswijk, signed in 1697 and named after the Dutch city in which it was signed. The treaty ended the Nine Years' War (1689-1697), in which Louis XIV's France faced a grand coalition of England, the Holy Roman Empire, the Dutch, and Spain. The treaty confirmed the effective disappearance of Spain as a maritime and continental power.

[^f10n7]: Martinico. Spanish name for the island of Martinique, the northernmost of the Windward Islands. Now an overseas department of France.  

[^f10n8]: The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) was part of the general settlement ending the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714). The treaty confirmed Philip V as King of Spain but required him to abandon his claim to the French throne. Additional provisions included the Spanish forfeiture of Gibraltar and Minorca to the British and the French forfeiture of claims to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Prince Rupert's Land in northern Canada. The French also had to give the formerly partitioned St. Kitts entirely to the British. The British received the Asiento as well, a monopoly contract to supply the Spanish Americas with enslaved Africans.
