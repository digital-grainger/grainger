[79]()

- His sire detested his Theana's House!—
- Thus duty, reverence, gratitude, conspir'd
- To check their happy union. He resolv'd [460]
- (And many a sigh that resolution cost)
- To pass the time, till death his sire remov'd,
- In visiting old Europe's letter'd climes:
- While she (and many a tear that parting drew)
- Embark'd, reluctant, for her native isle. [465]

- THO' learned, curious, and tho' nobly bent,
- With each rare talent to adorn his mind,
- His native land to serve; no joys he found.—
- Yet sprightly Gaul; yet Belgium, Saturn's reign;
- Yet Greece, of old the feat of every Muse, [470]
- Of freedom, courage; yet Ausonia's clime,
- His steps explor'd; where paiting, music's strains,
- Where arts, where laws, (philosophy's best child),
- With rival beauties, his attention claim'd.
- To his just-judging, his instructed eye, [475]
- The all-perfect Medicean Venus seem'd
- A perfect semblance of his Indian fair:
- But, when she spoke of love, her voice surpass'd
- The harmonious warblings of Italian song.
