[91]()

- Aid not, ye winds! with your destroying breath,
- The spreading vengeance.——They contemn my prayer. [65]

- ROUS'D by the deafning bells, the cries, the blaze;
- From every quarter, in tumultuous bands,
- The Negroes rush; and, 'mid the crackling flames,
- Plunge, dæmon-like! All, all, urge every nerve:
- This way, tear up those Canes; dash the fire out, [70]
- Which sweeps, with serpent-error, o'er the ground.
- There, hew these down; their topmost branches burn:
- And here bid all thy watery engines play;
- For here the wind the burning deluge drives.

- IN vain.——More wide the blazing torrent rolls;[75]
- More loud it roars, more bright it fires the pole!
- And toward thy mansion, see, it bends its way.
- Haste! far, O far, your infant-throng remove:
- Quick from your stables drag your steeds and mules:
- With well-wet blankets guard your cypress-roofs; [80]
- And where thy dried Canes in large stacks are pil'd.——

- EFFORTS but serve to irritate the flames:
- Naught but thy ruin can their wrath appease.
- Ah, my Palæmon! what avail'd thy care,

> VER. 81. *And where thy dried Canes*\] The Cane-stalks which have been ground, are called *Magoss*; probably a corruption of the French word *Bagasse*, which signifies the same thing. They make an excellent fewel.
