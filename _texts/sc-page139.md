[139]()

- The lurking evil from the blood expel,
- And throw it on the surface: There in spots [270]
- Which cause no pain, and scant ichor[^f139n1] yield,
- It chiefly breaks about the arms and hips,
- A virulent contagion!—When no more
- Round knobby spots deform, but the disease
- Seems at a pause: Then let the learned leach [275]
- Give, in due dose, live-silver[^f139n2] from the mine;
- Till copious spitting the whole taint exhaust.—
- Nor thou repine, tho' half-way round the sun,
- This globe, her annual progress shall absolve;
- Ere, clear'd, thy slave from all infection shine. [280]
- Nor then be confident; successive crops
- Of defaedations[^f139n3] oft will spot the skin:
- These thou, with turpentine and guaiac pods,[^f139n4]
- Reduc'd by coction to a wholesome draught,
- Total remove, and give the blood its balm. [285]

- SAY, as this malady but once infests
- The sons of Guinea, might not skill ingraft[^f139n4]
- (Thus, the small-pox are happily convey'd;)
- This ailment early to thy Negroe-train?

[^f139n1]: In Greek mythology, the ethereal fluid believed to have flowed through the veins of the gods. Here, Grainger means fluid from yaw lesions.

[^f139n2]: Mercury (or quicksilver) when taken as mercuric chloride (calomel). An important purgative in eighteenth-century medicine. Could also cause excessive salivation.   

[^f139n3]: The action of contaminating, polluting, or infecting something, especially the blood or skin. In this case, the periodic eruption of yaw sores.

[^f139n4]: guaiac pods. Refers to *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. Also widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.

[^f139n5]: Because yaws, like smallpox, seemed to infect a person only once in life, Grainger wonders whether inoculation might not be a good way to fight yaws. Popularized in Europe and the Americas as a treatment against smallpox in 1722, inoculation involved puncturing the skin of a healthy individual and deliberately infecting him or her with pustulent matter from a live smallpox sore. This procedure was extremely dangerous by modern standards because the virus was not attenuated and the inoculee came down with a case of smallpox. Inoculation nevertheless had a much lower rate of mortality than being infected by smallpox naturally.
