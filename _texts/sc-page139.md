[139]()

- The lurking evil from the blood expel,
- And throw it on the surface: There in spots [270]
- Which cause no pain, and scant ichor yield,
- It chiefly breaks about the arms and hips,
- A virulent contagion!——When no more
- Round knobby spots deform, but the disease
- Seems at a pause: Then let the learned leach [275]
- Give, in due dose, live-silver from the mine;
- Till copious spitting the whole taint exhaust.——
- Nor thou repine, tho' half-way round the sun,
- This globe, her annual progress shall absolve;
- Ere, clear'd, thy slave from all infection shine. [280]
- Nor then be confident; successive crops
- Of defedations oft will spot the skin:
- These thou, with turpentine and guaiac pods,
- Reduc'd by coction to a wholesome draught,
- Total remove, and give the blood its balm. [285]

- SAY, as this malady but once inserts
- The sons of Guinea, might not skill ingraft
- (Thus, the small-pox are happily convey'd;/)
- This ailment early to thy Negroe-train?
