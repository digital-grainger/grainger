- And, in the nectar of the yellowest Cane,
- Much acor, oil, and mucilage abound:

> VER. 350. *For taste, for colour, and for various use:*\] It were impossible, in the short limits of a note, to enumerate the various uses of Sugar; and, indeed, as thse are in general so well known, it is needless. A few properties of it, however, wherewith the learned are not commonly acquainted, I shall mention. In some places of the East-Indies, and excellent arrack is made from the Sugar-Cane: And, in South-America, Sugar is used as an antidote against one of the most sudden, as well as fatal poison in the world. Taken by mouth, *pcula morte carent*, this poison is quite innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood of the body immediately to the heart, it forthwith bursts it. The fish and birds killed by these poinsoned arrows \(in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert\) are perfectly wholesome to feed on. See Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon. It is a vegetable preparation.
> VER. 357. *That Cane*\] This, by the natives, is emphatically called the *Dumb Cane*; for a small quantity of its juice being rubbed on the brim of a drinking vessel, whoever drinks out of it, soon after will have his lips and tongue enormously swelled. A physician, however, who wrote a short account of the diseases of Jamaica, in Charles II.'s time, recommends it both by the mouth and externally, in dropsical and other cases: But I cannot say, I have had any experience of its efficacy in these disorders. It grows It grows wild in the mountains; and, by its use in Sugar-making, should seem to be somewhat of an alcalescent nature. It grows to four feet high, having, at the top, two green shining leaves, about nine inches long; and, between these, a small spire emerges.
