[118]()

- Deep, moral truths convey; while every beam [570]
- Flings on them transient tints, which vary when
- They wave their purple plumes; yet musical
- The love-lorn cooing of the mountain-dove,
- That woos to pleasing thoughtfulness the soul;
- But chief the breeze, the murmurs through yon canes, [575]
- Enchants the ear with tunable delight.

- WHILE such fair scenes adorn these blissful isles;
- Why will their sons, ungrateful, roam abroad?
- Why spend their opulence in other climes?

- SAY, is pre-eminence your partial aim?—— [580]
- Distinction courts you here; the senate calls.
- Here, crouching slaves, attendant wait your nod:
- While there, unnoted, but for folly's garb,
- For folly's jargon; your dull hours ye pass,
- Exlips'd by titles, and superior weath. [585]

- DOES martial ardour fire your generous veins?
- Fly to your native isles: Bellona, there,
- Hath long time rear'd her bloody flag; these isles
- Your strenuous arms demand; for ye are brave!
- Nor longer to the lute and taber's sound [590]
