[158]()

- Anon they form in ranks; nor inexpert
- A thousand tuneful intricacies weave,
- Shaking their sable limbs; and oft a kiss
- Steal from their partners; who, with neck reclin'd, [600]
- And semblant scorn, resent the ravish'd bliss.
- But let not thou the drum their mirth inspire;
- Nor vinous spirits: else, to madness fir'd, 
- (What will not bacchanalian frenzy dare?)
- Fell acts of blood, and vengeance they pursue. [605]

- COMPEL by threats, or win by soothing arts,
- Thy slaves to wed their fellow slaves at home;
- So shall they not their vigorous prime destroy,
- By distant journeys, at untimely hours,
- When muffled midnight decks her raven-hair [610]
- With the white plumage of the prickly vine,

- WOULD'ST thou from countless ails preserve thy gang;

> VER. 611. *prickly vine*\] This beautiful white rosaceous flower is as large as the crown of one's hat, and only blows at midnight. The plant, which is prickly and attaches itself firmly to the sides of houses, trees, *&c.* produces a fruit, which some call *Wythe Apple*, and others with more propriety, *Mountain strawberry*. But though it resembles the large Chili-strawberry in looks and size; yet being inelegant of taste, it is seldom eaten. The botanical name is *Cereus scandens minor*. The rind of the fruit is here and there studded with tufts of small sharp prickles.
