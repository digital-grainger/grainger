[75]()

- Or sends forth thick, blue, suffocating steams;
- Or shoots to temporary flame. A din,
- Wild, thro' the mountain's quivering rocky caves, [395]
- Like the dread crash of tumbling planets, roars.
- When tremble thus the pillars of the globe,
- Like the tall coco[^f75n1] by the fierce North blown;
- Can the poor, brittle, tenements of man
- Withstand the dread convulsion? Their dear homes, [400]
- (Which shaking, tottering, crashing, bursting, fall,)
- The boldest fly; and, on the open plain
- Appal'd, in agony the moment wait,
- When, with disrupture vast, the waving earth
- Shall whelm them in her sea-disgorging womb.[^f75n2] [405]

- NOR less affrighted are the bestial kind.
- The bold steed quivers in each panting vein,
- And staggers, bath'd in deluges of sweat:
- Thy lowing herds forsake their grassy food,
- And send forth frighted, woful, hollow sounds: [410]
- The dog, thy trusty centinel of night,
- Deserts his post assign'd; and, piteous, howls.——
- Wide ocean feels:——
- The mountain-waves, passing their custom'd bounds,


[^f75n1]: The coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*), which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia, has great powers of natural disperal since its nuts (the coconuts) can survive up to 120 days in seawater. Nevertheless, it is believed that Europeans introduced the coconut palm to the Caribbean in the sixteenth century. 

[^f75n2]: Grainger is describing a tsunami or tidal wave.
