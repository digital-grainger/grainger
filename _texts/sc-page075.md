- Appal'd, in agony the moment wait,
- When, with disrupture vast, the waving earth
- Shall whelm them in her sea-disgorging womb. [405]

- NOR less affrighted are the bestial kind.
- The bold steed quivers in each panting vein,
- And staggers, bath'd in deluges of sweat:
- Thy lowing herds forsake their grassy food,
- And send forth frighted, woful, hollow sounds: [410]

- The mountain-waves, passing their custom'd bounds,
