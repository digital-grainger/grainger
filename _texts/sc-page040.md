[40]()  

- For cooling vast impenetrable shade?  
- The muse, alas, th' experienc'd muse can tell: [570]  
- Oft hath she travell'd, while solstitial beams,  
- Shot yellow deaths on the devoted land;  
- Oft, oft hath she their ill-judg'd avarice blam'd,  
- Who, to the stranger, to their slaves and herds,  
- Denied this best of joys, the breezy shade. [575]  
- And are there none, whom generous pity warms,  
- Friends to the woodland reign; whom shades delight?  
- Who, round their green domains, plant hedge-row trees;  
- And with cool cedars, screen the public way?  
- Yes, good Montano; friend of man was he: [580]  
- Him persecution, virtue's deadliest foe,  
- Drove, a lorn exile, from his native shore;  
- From his green hills, where many a fleecy flock,  
- Where many a heifer cropt their wholesome food;  
- And many a swain, obedient to his rule, [585]  
- Him their lov'd master, their protector, own'd.  
- Yet, from that paradise, to Indian wilds,

> VER. 572. *yellow deaths*\] The yellow fever, to which Europeans of a sanguine habit of body, and who exceed in drinking or exercise, are liable on their arrival in the West Indies. The French call it *Maladie de Siame*, or more properly, *La Fievre des Matelots*. Those who have lived any time in the islands are no more subject to this disease than the Creoles, whence, however, some physicians have too hastily concluded, that it was of foreign extraction.
