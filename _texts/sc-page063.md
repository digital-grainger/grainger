- Gather'd by those, who drink the Volga's wave, [150]

- Equals your potency! Did planters know
- But half your virtues; not the Cane itself,
- Would they with greater, fonder pains preserve! 

- STILL other maladies infest the Cane, [155]
- And worse to be subdu'd. The insect-tribe
- That, fluttering, spread their pinions to the sun,
- Recal the muse: nor shall their many eyes,
- Tho' edg'd with gold, their many-colour'd down,
- From Death preserve them. In what distant clime, [160]
- In what recesses are the plunderers hatch'd?
- Say, are they wasted in the living gale,
- From distant islands? Thus, the locust-breed,
- In winged caravans, that blot the sky,
- Descend from far, and, ere bright morning dawn,
- Astonish'd Afric sees her crop devour'd. [165]
- Or, doth the Cane a proper nest afford,
- And food adapted to the yellow fly?——
- The skill'd in Nature's mystic lore observe,
- Each tree, each plant, that drinks the golden day, [170]
- Some reptile life sustains: Thus cochinille
