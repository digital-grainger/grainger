[134]()

- The earth's dark surface; where sulphureous flames, [170]
- Oft from their vapoury prisons bursting wild,
- To dire explosion give the cavern'd deep,
- And in dread ruin all its inmates whelm?——
- Nor fateful only is the bursting flame;
- The exhalations of the deep-dug mine, [175]
- Tho' slow, shake from their wings as sure a death.
- With what intense severity of pain
- Hath the afflicted muse, in Scotia, seen
- THe miners rack'd, who toil for fatal lead?
- What cramps, what palsies shake their feeble limbs, [180]
- Who, on the margin of the rocky Drave,
- Trace silver's fluent ore? Yet white men these!

- HOW far more happy ye, than those poor slaves,
- Who, whilom, under native, gracious chiefs,
- Incas and emperors, long time enjoy'd [185]
- Mild government, with every sweet of life,
- In blissful climates? See them dragg'd in chains,
- By proud insulting tyrants, to the mines
- Which once they call'd their own, and then despised!
