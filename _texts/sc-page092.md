[92]({{site.baseurl}}/images/{{page.img}})

- Oft to prevent the earliest dawn of day, [85]
- And walk thy ranges, at the noon of night?
- What tho' no ills assail'd thy bunching sprouts,
- And seasons pour'd obedient to thy will:
- All, all must perish; nor shalt thou preserve
- Wherewith to feed thy little orphan-throng. [90]

- OH, may the Cane-isles know few nights, like this!
- For now the sail-clad points,[^f92n1] impatient, wait
- The hour of sweet release, to court the gale.
- The late-hung coppers[^f92n2] wish to feel the warmth,
- Which well-dried fewel from the Cane imparts: [95]
- The Negroe-train, with placid looks, survey
- Thy fields, which full perfection have attain'd,
- And pant to wield the bill: \(no surly watch
- Dare now deprive them of the luscious Cane:\)[^f92n3]
- Nor thou, my friend, their willing ardour check; [100]
- Encourage rather; cheerful toil is light.
- So from no field, shall slow-pac'd oxen draw
- More frequent loaded wanes;[^f92n4] which many a day,
- And many a night shall feed thy crackling mills
- With richest offerings:[^f92n5] while thy far seen flames, [105]
- Bursting thro' many a chimney, bright emblaze
- The AEthiop-brow[^f92n6] of night. And see, they pour

[^f92n1]: Windmill sails.  

[^f92n2]: Copper pots used for boiling cane juice.  

[^f92n3]: In his *An Essay on the More Common West-India Diseases* (1764), Grainger writes that enslaved laborers "should not only be allowed to drink what quantity of the cane juice they think proper, but even obliged to drink it" during crop time (10). However, plantesr sometimes inflicted severe punishments when the enslaved ate or consumed sugar cane. For example, the eighteenth-century Jamaican planter Thomas Thistlewood punished an enslaved African named Egypt for eating sugarcane by whipping him and giving him "Derby's dose," a phrase Thistlewood used to refer to the act of having one enslaved African defecate in another's mouth (Hall 73).  

[^f92n4]: A wane is a large open vehicle or wagon drawn by horses or oxen and used to carry heavy loads, especially of agricultural produce.  

[^f92n5]: Cane juice begins to spoil as soon as the plant is cut. As a result, planters preferred to run their mills and boiling houses 24 hours per day during crop time.  

[^f92n6]: Aethiop and Aethiopia (also Ethiop and Ethiopian) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Aethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Aethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Aethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference based on skin color.
