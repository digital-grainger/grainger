[69]()

- SAY, can the Muse, the pencil in her hand, [270]
- The all-wasting hurricane observant ride?
- Can she, undazzled, view the lightning's glare,
- That fires the welkin? Can she, unappall'd,
- When all the flood-gates of the sky are ope,
- The shoreless deluge stem? The Muse hath seen [275]
- The pillar'd flame, whose top hath reach'd the stars;
- Seen rocky, molten fragments, flung in air
- From AEtna's vext abyss; seen burning streams
- Pour down its challen'd sides; tremendous scenes!—
- Yet not vext Ætna's pillar'd flames, that strike [280]
- The stars; nor molten mountains hurl'd on high;
- Nor ponderous rapid deluges, that burn
- Its deeply-channel'd sides: cause such dismay,
- Such desolation, Hurricane! as thou;
- When the Almighty gives thy rage to blow, [285]
- And all the battles of thy winds engage.

- SOON as the Virgin's charms ingross the Sun;
- And till his weaker flame the Scorpion feels;
- But, chief, while Libra weighs the unsteddy year:
- Planter, with mighty proprs thy dome support; [290]
- Each flaw repair; and well, with massy bars,
