[36]()  

- Yet, if the cholic's deathful pangs thou dread'st,  
- Taste not its luscious nut. The acassee, [510]  
- With which the sons of Jewry, stiff-neck'd race,  
- Conjecture says, our God-Messiah crown'd;  
- Soon shoots a thick impenetrable fence,  
- Whose scent perfumes the night and morning sky,  
- Tho' baneful be its root. The privet too, [515]  
- Whose white flowers rival the first drifts of snow  
- On Grampia's piny hills; \(O might the muse  
- Tread, flush'd with health, the Grampian hills again!\)  
- Emblem of innocence shall grace my song.  
- Boast of the shrubby tribe, carnation fair, [520]  
- Nor thou repine, tho' late the muse record

> VER. 510. *the acassee,*\] *Acacia*. This is a species of thorn; the juice of the root is supposed to be poisonous. Its seeds are contained in a pod or ligumen. It is of the class of the syngenesia. No astringent juice is extracted from it. Its trivial name is *Cashaw*. Tournefort describes it in his voyage to the Levant. Some call it the Holy Thorn, and others Sweet Brier. The half-ripe pod affords a strong cement; and the main stem, being wounded, produces a transparent gum, like the Arabic, to which tree this bears a strong resemblance.

> VER. 515. *the privet*\] *Ligustrum*. This shrub is sufficiently known. Its leaves and flowers make a good gargle in the aphthae, and ulcered throat.

> VER. 520. *carnation fair.*\] This is indeed a most beautiful flowering shrub. It is a native of the West-Indies, and called, from a French governor, named Depoinci, *Poinciana*. If permitted, it will grow twenty feet high; but, in order to make it a good fence, it should be kept low. It is always in blossom. Tho' not purgative, it is of the senna kind. Its leaves and flowers are stomachic, carminative, and emmenagogue. Some authors name it *Cauda pavonis*, on account of its inimitable beauty; the flowers have a physicky smell. How it came to be called *Doodle-doo* I know not; the Barbadians more properly term it *Flower Fence*. This plant grows also in Guinea.
