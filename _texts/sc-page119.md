[119]()

- Weave antic measures. O, could my weak song,
- O could my song, like his, heaven-favoured bard,
- Who led desponding Sparta's oft-beat hosts,
- To victory, to glory; fire your souls
- With English ardor! for now England's swains, [595]
- (The Man of Norfolk, swains of England, thank;)
- All emulous, to Freedom's standard fly,
- And drive invasion from their native shore:
- How would my soul exult with conscious pride;
- Nor grudge those wreaths Tyrtaeus gain'd of yore. [600]

- OR are ye fond of rich luxurious cates?â€”
- Can aught in Europe emulate the pine,
- Or fruit forbidden, native of your isles?
- Sons of Apicius, say, can Europe's seas,
- Can aught the edible creation yields, [605]
- Compare with turtle, boast of land and wave?
- Can Europe's seas, in all their finny realms,
- Aught so delicious as the Jew-fish show?
- Tell me what viands, land or streams produce,

> VER. 608. *Jew-Fish*] This, tho' a very large, is one of the most delicate fishes that swim; being preferable to caramaw, king-fish, or camaree: some even chuse it before turtle. The Jew-fish is often met with at Antigua, which enjoys the happiness of having on its coast few, if any, poisoned fishes.
