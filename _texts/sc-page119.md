[119]()

- Weave antic measures. O, could my weak song,
- O could my song, like his, heaven-favoured bard,
- Who led desponding Sparta's oft-beat hosts,
- To victory, to glory; fire your souls
- With English ardor! for now England's swains, [595]
- (The Man of Norfolk,[^f119n1] swains of England, thank;)
- All emulous, to Freedom's standard fly,
- And drive invasion from their native shore:[^f119n2]
- How would my soul exult with conscious pride;
- Nor grudge those wreaths Tyrtaeus gain'd of yore.[^f119n3] [600]

- OR are ye fond of rich luxurious cates?â€”
- Can aught in Europe emulate the pine,[^f119n4]
- Or fruit forbidden, native of your isles?
- Sons of Apicius,[^f119n5] say, can Europe's seas,
- Can aught the edible creation yields, [605]
- Compare with turtle, boast of land and wave?
- Can Europe's seas, in all their finny realms,
- Aught so delicious as the Jew-fish[^f119n6] show?
- Tell me what viands, land or streams produce,

> VER. 596. *The Man of Norfolk,*] The Honourable General George Townshend.

> VER. 608. *Jew-Fish*] This, tho' a very large, is one of the most delicate fishes that swim; being preferable to caramaw, king-fish,[^f119n7] or camaree: some even chuse it before turtle. The Jew-fish is often met with at Antigua, which enjoys the happiness of having on its coast few, if any, poisoned fishes.

[^f119n1]: George Townshend, first Marquess Townshend (1724-1807), an English politician and caricaturist who also had a distinguished military career, serving as second in command to Major-General James Wolfe in Canada during the Seven Years' War and then as overall commander after Wolfe's death during the campaign to take French-held Quebec, which surrendered to British forces in 1759.

[^f119n2]: Probably refers to a failed attempt in 1759 by French forces to invade Britain.

[^f119n3]: Tyrtaeus was a Spartan poet of the mid-seventh century BCE who wrote about the Second Messenian War and exhorted Spartans to fight to the death for their city. Sparta was a powerful city-state in ancient Greece.  

[^f119n4]: The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*) originated in Central or South America. It was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean (Higman 188).

[^f119n5]: Apicius, a name used for several Roman connoisseurs of luxury but especially Marcus Gavius Apicius, a gourmet who lived during the reign of Tiberius (CE 14-37). He exhausted his fortune on feasts and committed suicide rather than economize. 

[^f119n6]: Jew-fish, the Atlantic goliath grouper (*Epinephelus itajara*). A large sporting and food fish of warm coastal waters. Its range includes the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Now a critically endangered species. Because it is not clear if the name Jewfish invokes a history of anti-Semitic associations, it was officially changed in 2001 by the American Fisheries Society to Atlantic goliath grouper.

[^f119n7]: Also known as the king mackerel (*Scomberomorus cavalla*), which is found in the western Atlantic from Massachusetts to Brazil.
