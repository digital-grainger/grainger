[108]()

- And in whose strains your praises shall endure,
- While to Sabrina speeds your healing stream. [380]

- BRISTOL, without thy marble, by the flame
- Calcin'd to whiteness, vain the stately reed
- Would swell with juice mellifluent; heat would soon
- The strongest, best-hung furnaces, consume.
- Without its aid the cool-imprison'd stream, [385]
- Seldom allow'd to view the face of day,
- Tho' late it roam'd a denizen of air;
- Would steal from its involuntary bounds,
- And, by sly windings, set itself at large.
- But chief thy lime the experienc'd boiler loves, [390]
- Nor loves ill-founded; when no other art
- Can bribe to union the coy floating salts,
- A proper portion of this precious dust,
- Cast in the wave, \(so showers alone of gold
- Could win fair Danae to the God's embrace;\) [395]
- With nectar'd muscovado soon will charge
- Thy shelving coolers, which, severely press'd
- Between the fingers, not resolves; and which
- Rings in the cask; and or a light-brown hue,
- Or thine, more precious silvery-grey, assumes. [400]
