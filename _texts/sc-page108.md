- And in whose strains your praises shall endure,
- While to Sabrina[^f108n1] speeds your healing stream. [380]

- BRISTOL, without thy marble,[^f108n2] by the flame
- Calcin'd to whiteness, vain the stately reed
- Would swell with juice mellifluent; heat would soon
- The strongest, best-hung furnaces, consume.
- Without its aid the cool-imprison'd stream, [385]
- Seldom allow'd to view the face of day,
- Tho' late it roam'd a denizen of air;
- Would steal from its involuntary bounds,
- And, by sly windings, set itself at large.
- But chief thy lime the experienc'd boiler loves, [390]
- Nor loves ill-founded; when no other art
- Can bribe to union the coy floating salts,
- A proper portion of this precious dust,
- Cast in the wave, (so showers alone of gold
- Could win fair Danae[^f108n3] to the God's embrace;) [395]
- With nectar'd muscovado soon will charge
- Thy shelving coolers, which, severely press'd
- Between the fingers, not resolves; and which
- Rings in the cask; and or a light-brown hue,
- Or thine, more precious silvery-grey, assumes. [400]

[^f108n1]: Avon refers to the Bristol Avon, a river in southwest England. It is different from Shakespeare's Avon. Sugar houses or refineries lined the Avon in the eighteenth century, as access to water was crucial during the refining process. 

[^f108n2]: A metamorphic rock formed by applying great heat and pressure to limestone.

[^f108n3]: Daughter of King Acrisius of Argos and Queen Eurydice, also mother of Perseus by Zeus, who impregnated Danae in the form of a shower of gold.
