- Their sylvan law convey: O may I join 
- This choral band, and from their precepts learn \[15]
- To deck my theme, which though to song unknown,
- Is most momentous to my country’s weal!

- So shall my numbers win the Public ear;
- And not displease Aurelius; him to whom,
- Imperial George, the monarch of the main, \[20]
- Hath given to wield the scepter of those isles,
- Where first the Muse beheld the spiry Cane,
- Supreme of plants, rich subject of my song.

> VER. 22. *the spiry Cane*,\] The botanical name of the Cane is Saccharum. The Greeks and Romans seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful plant. Lucan and Pliny are the only Authors among the former who mention it; and so far as I can find, Arrian is the only Greek. The first of these Writers, in enumerating Pompey’s Eastern auxiliaries, describes a nation who made use of the Cane juice as a drink.  
     *Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos*  
The industrious Naturalist says, Saccharum et Arabia fert, sed laudatius India; and the Greek Historian, in his &#960&#949&#961&#953&#960&#955&#959&#965&#963 of the Red-sea, tells us of a neighboring nation who drank it also; his words are, &#956&#949&#955&#953 &#964&#959 &#967&#945&#955&#945&#956&#953&#965&#959&#965 &#964&#959 &#955&#949&#947&#965 &#963&#945&#967&#935&#945&#961&#953. The Cane, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably cultivated there time immermorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of; they aftwerwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the etymology, for the Arabic word &#1512&#1499&#1513 is evidently derived from the Hebrew &#1512&#1499&#64299 , which signifies an *intoxicating liquor*. When the Indians began to make the Cane-juice into sugar, I cannot discover; probably, it soon found its way into Europe in that form, first by the Res-sea, and afterwards through Persia, by the Black-sea and Caspian; but the plant itself was not known to Europe, till the Arabians introduced it into the southernn parts of Spain, Sicily, and those provinces of France which bor-
