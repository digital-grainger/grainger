[138]()

- NOR only is the dragon worm to dread:
- Fell, winged insects, which the visual ray
- Scarcely discerns, their sable feet and hands
- Oft penetrate; and, in the fleshy nest,
- Myriads of young produce; which soon destroy [260]
- The parts they breed in; if assiduous care,
- With art, extract not the prolific foe.

- OR, shall she sing, and not debase her lay,
- The pest peculiar to the Aethiop-kind,
- The yaw's infectious bane?â€”The infected far [265]
- In huts, to leeward, lodge; or near the main.
- With heartning food, with turtle, and which conchs;
- The flowers of sulphur, and hard niccars burnt,

> VER. 257. *winged insects*] These, by the English, are called *Chigoes* or *Chigres*. They chiefly perforate the toes, and sometimes the fingers; occasioning an itching, which some people think not unpleasing, and are at pains to get, by going to the copper-holes, or mill-round, where chigres most abound. They lay their nits in a bag, about the size of a small pea, and are partly contained therein themselves. This the Negroes extract without bursting, by means of a needle, and filling up the place with a little snuff; it soon heals, if the person has a good constitution. One species of them is supposed to be poisonous; but, I believe, unjustly. When they bury themselves near a tendon, especially if the person is in a bad habit of body, they occasion troublesome sores. The South-Americans call them *Miguas*.

> VER. 268. *niccars*] The botanical name of this medicinal shrub is *Guilandina*. The fruit resembles marbles, though not so round. Their shell is hard and smooth, and contains a farinaceous nut, of admirable use in seminal weaknesses. They are also given to throw out the yaws.
