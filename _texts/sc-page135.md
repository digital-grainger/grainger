[135]({{site.baseurl}}/images/{{page.img}})

- See, in the mineral bosom of their land, [190]
- How hard they toil! how soon their youthful limbs
- Feel the decrepitude of age! how soon
- Their teeth desert their sockets! and how soon
- Shaking paralysis unstrings their frame!
- Yet scarce, even then, are they allow'd to view [195]
- The glorious God of day, of whom they beg,
- With earnest hourly supplications, death;
- Yet death slow comes, to torture them the more!

- WITH these compar'd, ye sons of Afric, say,
- How far more happy is your lot? Bland health, [200]
- Of ardent eye, and limb robust, attends
- Your custom'd labour; and, should sickness seize,
- With what solicitude are ye not nurs'd!â€”
- Ye Negroes, then, your pleasing task pursue;[^f135n1]
- And, by your toil, deserve your master's care. [205]

- WHEN first your Blacks are novel to the hoe;
- Study their humours:[^f135n2] Some, soft-soothing words;
- Some, presents; and some, menaces subdue;
- And some I've known, so stubborn is their kind,
- Whom blows, alas! could win alone to toil. [210]

[^f135n1]: The georgic mode is invested in describing the benefits of healthful agricultural labor. It is entirely conventional to describe that labor as pleasing, but, at this moment, *The Sugar-Cane* is describing enslaved labor.  

[^f135n2]: Moods.
