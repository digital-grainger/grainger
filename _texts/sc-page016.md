- Change, like Medusa's head, whate'er they touch,
- To stony hardness; boast this fertile glebe.

- Tho' such the soils the Antillean Cane 
- Supremely loves; yet other soils abound,
- Which art may tutor to obtain its smile. \[140]
- Say, shall the experienc'd Muse that art recite?
- How sand will fertilize stiff barren clay?
- How clay unites the light, the porous mould,
- Sport of each breeze? And how the torpid nymph
- Of the rank pool, so noisome to the smell, \[145]
- May be solicited, by wily ways, 
- To draw her humid train, and, prattling, run
- Down the reviving slopes? Or shall she say
- What glebes ungrateful to each other art,
- Their genial treasures ope to fire alone? \[150]
- Record the different composts; which the cold
- To plastic gladness warm? The torrid, which
- By soothing coolness win? The sharp saline,
- Which best subdue? Which mollify the sour?

Anne's time, they were always repulsed with considerable loss. It was settled by that great adventurer Sir Thomas Warner, *A.D.* 1632, who sent thither some of his people from St. Christopher, for that purpose. In the beginning of the reign of Charles II. the French took it, but it was restored, *A.D.* 1667, by the treaty of Breda. In this island, the Roman-catholics, who behaved well when our enemies attempted to conquer it, have many privileges, and of course are more numerous there, than in any other of the English Caribbee-islands. Its capital is called Plymouth. Columbus discovered it in his second voyage.
