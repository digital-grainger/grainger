[19]()

- PLANTER, if thou with wonder wouldst survey
- Redundant harvests,[^f19n1] load thy willing soil;
- Let sun and rain mature thy deep-hoed land,
- And old fat dung co-operate with these. [200]
- Be this great truth still present to thy mind;
- The half well-cultur'd far exceeds the whole,
- Which lust of gain, unconscious of its end,
- Ungrateful vexes with unceasing toil.

- AS, not indulg'd, the richest lands grow poor; [205]
- And Liamuiga may, in future times,
- If too much urg'd, her barrenness bewail:
- So cultivation, on the shallowest soil,
- O'erspread with rocky cliffs, will bid the Cane,
- With spiry pomp, all bountifully rise. [210]
- Thus Britain's flag, should discipline relent,
- \'Spite of the native courage of her sons,
- Would to the lily[^f19n2] strike: ah, very far,
- Far be that woful day: the lily then
- Will rule wide ocean with resistless sway; [215]
- And to old Gallia's[^f19n3] haughty shore transport
- The lessening crops of these delicious isles.
