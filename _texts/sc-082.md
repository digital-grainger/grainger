[82]()

- THO' faster than the Tropic-bird they flew,
- Oft Junio cried, ah! when shall we see land? [510]
- Soon land they made: and now in thought he claspt
- His Indian bride, and deem'd his toils o'erpaid.

- SHE, no less amorous, every evening walk'd
- On the cool margin of the purple main,
- Intent her Junio's vessel to descry. [515]

- ONE eve, (faint calms for many a day had rag'd,)
- The winged daemons of the tempest rose;
- Thunder, and rain, and lightning's awful power.
- She fled: could innocence, could beauty claim
- Exemption from the grave; the aethereal Bolt, [520]
- That stretch'd her speechless, o'er her lovely head
- Had innocently roll'd.

- MEAN while, impatient Junior lept ashore,
- Regardless of the Daemons of the storm.
- Ah youth! what woes, too great for man to bear, [525]
- Are ready to burst on thee? Urge not so
- Thy flying courser. Soon Theana's porch
