[130]()

- Soon grow familiar; while unusual toil,
- And new severities their husbands kill.

- THE slaves from Minnah are of stubborn breed:
- But, when the bill, or hammer, they affect; [100]
- They soon perfection reach. But fly, with care,
- The Moco-nation; they themselves destroy.

- WORMS lurk in all: yet, pronest they to worms,
- Who from Mundingo sail. When therefore such
- Thou buy'st, for sturdy and laborious they, [105]
- Straight let some learned leach strong medicines give,
- Till food and climate both familiar grow.
- Thus, tho' from rise to set, in Phoebus' eye,
- They toil, unceasing; yet, at night, they'll sleep,
- Lap'd in Elysium; and, each day, at dawn, [110]
- Spring from their couch, as blythsome as the sun.

- ONE precept more, it much imports to know.â€”
- The Blacks, who drink the Quanza's lucid stream,
- Fed by ten thousand springs, are prone to bloat, 
- Whether at home or in these ocean-isles: [115]
- And tho' nice art the water may subdue,
