[34]()  

- OF mountain-lands oeconomy permits  
- A third, in Canes of mighty growth to rise:  
- But, in the low-land plain, the half will yield [480]  
- Tho' not so lofty, yet a richer Cane,  
- For many a crop; if seasons glad the soil.  

- WHILE rolls the Sun from Aries to the Bull,  
- And till the Virgin his hot beams inflame;  
- The Cane, with richest, most redundant juice, [485]  
- Thy spacious coppers fills. Then manage so,  
- By planting in succession; that thy crops  
- The wondering daughters of the main may waft  
- To Britain's shore, ere Libra weight the year:  
- So shall thy merchant chearful credit grant, [490]  
- And well-earn'd opulence thy cares repay.  

- THY fields thus planted; to secure the Canes  
- From the Goat's baneful tooth; the churning boar;  
- From thieves; from fire or casual or design'd;  
- Unfailing herbage to thy toiling herds [495]  
- Would'st thou afford; and the spectators charm  
- With beauteous prospects: let the frequent hedge  
- Thy green plantation, regular, divide.
