[152]()

- Thee, the first natives of these Ocean-isles,
- Fell anthropophagi, still sacred held;
- And from thy large high-flavour'd fruit abstain'd, [505]
- With pious awe; for thine high-flavoured fruit,
- The airy phantoms of their friends deceas'd
- Joy'd to regale on.——Such their simple creed.
- The tamarind likewise should adorn her theme,
- With whole tart fruit the sweltering fever loves [510]
- To quench his thirst, whose breezy umbrage soon
- Shades the pleas'd planter, shades his children long.
- Nor, lofty cassia, should she not recount
- Thy woodland honours! See, what yellow flowers
- Dance in the gale, and scent the ambient air; [515]
- While thy long pods, full-fraught with nectared sweets,
- Relieve the bowels from their lagging load.
- Nor chirimoia, though these torrid isles
- Boast not thy fruit, to which the anana yields
- In taste and flavour, wilt thou coy refuse [520]

> *&c.* is truly exquisite. This tree, contrary to most others in the New World, shoots up to a pyramidal figure: the leaves are uncommonly green; and it produces fruit, but once a year. The names is Indian. The English commonly call it *Mammey-sapota*. There are two species of it, the sweet, and the tart. The botanical name is *Achras*.
