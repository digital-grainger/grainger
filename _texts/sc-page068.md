[68]()

- Labour immense! and yet, if small the pest;
- If numerous, if industrious be thy gang;
- At length, thou may'st the victory obtain. [250]
- But, if the living taint be far diffus'd,
- Bootless this toil; nor will it then avail
- (Tho' ashes lend their suffocating aid)
- To bare the broad roots, and the mining swarms
- Expose, remorseless, to the burning noon. [255]
- Ah! must then ruin desolate the plain?
- Must the lost planter other climes explore?
- Howe'er reluctant, let the hoe uproot
- The infected Cane-piece; and, with eager flames,
- The hostile myriads thou to embers turn: [260]
- Far better, thus, a mighty loss sustain,
- Which happier years and prudence may retrieve;
- Than risque thine all. As when an adverse storm,
- Impetuous, thunders on some luckless ship,
- From green St. Christopher, or Cathäy[^f68n1] bound: [265]
- Each nautic art the reeling seamen try:
- The storm redoubles: death rides every wave:
- Down by the board the cracking masts they hew;
- And heave their precious cargo in the main.

> VER. 265. *Cathäy*\] An old name for China.

[^f68n1]: The name by which China was known to medieval Europe.
