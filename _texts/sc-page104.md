[104]()

- Or from thine ore, bright Venus, they are drawn;
- Or hammer, or hot fusion, give them form.
- If prudence guides thee then, thy stores shall hold [315]
- Of well-siz'd vessels a complete supply:
- For every hour, thy boilers cease to skim,
- \(Now Cancer reddens with the solar ray,\)
- Defeats thy honest purposes of gain.

- NOR small the risque, \(when piety, or chance, [320]
- Force thee from boiling to desist\) to lave
- Thy heated furnace, with the gelid stream.
- The chemist knows, when all-dissolving fire
- Bids the metalline ore abruptly flow;
- What dread explosions, and what dire effects, [325]
- A few cold drops of water will produce,
- Uncautious, on the novel fluid thrown.

- FOR grain and colour, wouldst thou win, my friend,
- At every curious mart, the constant palm?
- O'er all thy works let cleanliness preside, [330]
- Child of frugality; and, as the skum

> disadvantages. The teache, or smallest vessel from whence the Sugar is laved into the cooler, is generally copper. When it melts, it can be patched; but, when the large sort of vessels, called iron-furnaces, crack, which they are too apt to do, no further use can be made of them.
