[137]()

- 'Twould be the fond ambition of her soul,
- To quell tyrannic sway; knock off the chains [235]
- Of heart-debasing slavery; give to man,
- Of every colour and of every clime,
- Freedom, which stamps him image of his God.
- Then laws, Oppression's scourge, fair Virtue's prop,
- Offspring of Wisdom! should impartial reign, [240]
- To knit the whole in well-accorded strife:
- Servants, not slaves; of choice, and not compell'd;
- The Blacks should cultivate the Cane-land isles.

- SAY, shall the muse the various ills recount,
- Which Negroe-nations feel? Shall she describe [245]
- The worm that subtly winds into their flesh,
- All as they bathe them in their native streams?
- There, with fell increment, it soon attains
- A direful length of harm. Yet, if due skill,
- And proper circumspection are employed, [250]
- It may be won its volumes to wind round
- A leaden cylinder: But, O, beware,
- No rashness practise; else 'twill surely snap,
- And suddenly, retreating, dire produce
- An annual lameness to the tortured Moor. [255]
