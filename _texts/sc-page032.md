[32]()  

- Friend to the Cane-isles; trust not thou thy tops,  
- Thy future riches, to the low-land plain: [435]  
- And if kind Heaven, in pity to thy prayers,  
- Shed genial influence; as the earth absolves  
- Her annual circuit, thy rich ripened Canes  
- Shall load thy waggons, mules, and Negroe-train.

- BUT chief thee, Planter, it imports to mark [440]  
- \(Whether thou breathe the mountain's humid air,  
- Or pant with heat continual on the plain;\)  
- What months relent, and which from rain are free.  

- IN different islands of the ocean-stream,  
- Even in the different parts of the same isle, [445]  
- The seasons vary; yet attention soon  
- Will give thee each variety to know.  
- This once observ'd; at such a time inhume  
- Thy plants, that, when they joint, \(important age,  
- Like youth just stepping into life\) the clouds [450]  
- May constantly bedew them: so shall they  
- Avoid those ails, which else their manhood kill.  

- SIX times the changeful moon must blunt her horns,  
- And fill with borrowed light her silvery urn;
