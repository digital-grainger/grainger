[115]()

- How would your converse polish my rude lays,
- With what new, noble images adorn? [520]
- Then should I scarce regret the banks of Thames,
- All as we sat beneath that sand-box shade;
- Whence the delighted eye expatiates wide
- O'er the fair landscape; where in loveliest forms,
- Green cultivation hath array'd the land. [525]

- SEE! there, what mills, like giants raise their arms,
- To quell the speeding gale! what smoke ascends
- From every boiling house! What structures rise,
- Neat tho' not lofty, pervious to the breeze;
- With galleries, porches, or piazzas grac'd! [530]
- Nor not delightful are those reed-built huts,
- On yonder hill, that front the rising sun;
- With plantanes, with banana's bosom'd-deep,
- That flutter in the wind: where frolick goats,

> VER. 522. *sand-box*\] So called, from the pericarpium's being often made use of for containing sand; when the seeds, which are a violent emetic, are taken out. This is a fine shady tree, especially when young; and its leaves are efficaciously applied in headachs to the temples, which they sweat. It grows fast; but loses much of its beauty by age. Its wood is brittle, and when cut emits a milky juice, which is not caustic. The sand-box thrives best in warm shady places. The sun often splits the pericarpium, which then cracks like a pistol. It is round, flatted both above and below, and divided into a great number of regular compartments, each of which contains one seed flatted ovularly. The botanical name is *Hura*.
