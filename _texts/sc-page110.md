[110]()

- For, if the skies too frequently relent,
- Crude flows the Cane-juice, and will long elude
- The boiler's wariest skill: thy Canes will spring
- To an unthrifty loftiness; or, weighed[^f110n1] [425] 
- Down by their load, (Ambition's curse,) decay.

- ENCOURAGE thou thy boilers; much depends
- On their skill'd efforts. If too soon they strike,
- E'er all the watery particles have fled;
- Or lime sufficient granulate the juice: [430]
- In vain the thickning liquor is effus'd;
- An heterogeneous, an uncertain mass,
- And never in thy coolers to condense.

- OR, planter, if the coction[^f110n2] they prolong
- Beyond its stated time; the viscous wave [435]

> VER. 428. *If too soon they strike,*\] When the Cane-juice is granulated sufficiently, which is known by the Sugar's sticking to the ladle, and roping like a syrup, but breaking off from its edges; it is poured into a cooler, where, its surface being smoothed, the christallization is soon completed. This is called *striking*. The general precept is to temper high, and strike low. When the Muscovado is of a proper consistence, it is dug out of the cooler, and put into hogsheads; this is called *potting*. The casks being placed upon staunchions, the melasses[^f110n3] drips from them into a cistern, made on purpose, below them, to receive it. The Sugar is sufficiently cured, when the hogshead rings upon being struck with a stick; and when the two canes, which are put into every cask, shew no melasses upon them, when drawn out of it.

[^f110n1]: The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "weighed" should read "weigh'd."  

[^f110n2]: Boiling, cooking. 

[^f110n3]: Also molasses, the thick, brown, uncrystallized syrup drained from raw sugar.
