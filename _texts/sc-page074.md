[74]()

- Thrice hapless he, whom thus the hand of fate
- Compels to risque the insufferable beam!
- A fiend, the worst the angry skies ordain
- To punish sinful man, shall fatal seize
- His wretched life, and to the tomb consign. [380]

- WHEN such the ravage of the burning calm,
- On the stout, sunny children of the hill;
- What must thy Cane-lands feel? Thy late green sprouts
- Nor bunch, nor joint; but, sapless, arid, pine:
- Those, who have manhood reach'd, of yellow hue, [385]
- (Symptom of health and strength) soon ruddy show;
- While the rich juice that circled in their veins,
- Acescent, watery, poor, unwholesome tastes.

- NOR only, planter, are thy Cane-groves burnt;
- Thy life is threatened. Muse, the manner sing. [390]

- THEN earthquakes, nature's agonizing pangs,
- Oft shake the astonied isles: The solsaterre

> VER. 392. *solsaterre*\] Volcanos are called *sulphurs*, *or solsaterres*, in the West-Indies. There are few mountainous islands in that part of the globe without them, and those probably will destroy them in time. I saw much sulphur and alum in the solsaterre at Mountserrat. The stream that runs through it, is almost as hot as boiling water, and its steams soon blacken silver, *&c*.
