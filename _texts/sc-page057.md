[57]()

- Nor kill the winding snake, thy foes they eat.
- Thus, on the mangrove-banks of Guayaquil,
- Child of the rocky desert, sea-like stream, [70]

- Dread alligators would alone possess.
- Thy foes, the teeth-fil'd Ibbos also love; [75]
- Nor thou their wayward appetite restrain.

Osyters often adhere to their roots, *&c*. The French name of this strange water-shrub is *Paltuvier*. The species meant here is the red mangrove.

> VER 74. *Dread alligators*\] This dreadful animal is amphibious, and seldom lays fewer than 100 eggs. These she carefully covers with sand. But, notwithstanding this precution, the gallinazo (a large species of carrion-crow) conceals itself among the thick boughs of the neighbouring trees, and thus often discovers the hoard of the alligator, which she no sooner leaves, than the gallinazo souses down upon it, and greedily scraping off the sand, regales on its contents. Nor is the male alligator less an enemy to the increase of his own horrid brood, than these useful birds; for, when Instinct prompts the female to let her young fry out by breaking the eggs, he never fails to accompany her, and to devour as many of them as he can: So that the mother scarce ever escapes into the river with more than five out of all her hundred. Thus providence doubly prevents the otherwise immense propagation of that voracious animal, on the banks of the river Guayaquil; for the gallinazo is not always found, where alligators are. *Ulloa*. 

> VER. 75. *teeth-fil'd Ibbos*\] Or *Ebbos*, as they are more commonly called, are a numerous nation. Many of them have their teeth filed, and blacked in an extraordinary manner. They make good slaves when bought young; but are, in general,
