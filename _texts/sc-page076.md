[76]()

- Make direful, loud incursions on the land, [415]
- All-overwhelming: Sudden they retreat,
- With their whole troubled waters; but, anon,
- Sudden return, with louder, mightier force;
- (The black rocks whiten, the vext shores resound;)
- And yet, more rapid, distant they retire. [420]
- Vast coruscations lighten all the sky,
- With volum'd flames; while thunder's awful voice,
- From forth his shrine, by night and horror girt,
- Astounds the guilty, and appals the good:
- For oft the best, smote by the bolt of heaven, [425]
- Wrapt in ethereal flame, forget to live:
- Else, fair Theana.[^f76n1]â€”Muse, her fate deplore.

- SOON as young reason dawn'd in Junio's breast,
- His father sent him from these genial isles,[^76n2]
- To where old Thames[^f76n3] with conscious pride surveys [430]
- Green Eton,[^f76n4] soft abode of every Muse.
- Each classic beauty soon he made his own;
- And soon fam'd Isis[^f76n5] saw him woo the Nine,[^f76n6]

[^f76n1]: From here to the end of Book 2, Grainger tells the fictional love story of Junio and Theana. The story itself is conventional, borrowing from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*, as well as the story of Inkle and Yarico, first told by Richard Ligon in *A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657) and retold as a sentimental tale in Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's *The Spectator* (No. 11, 13 March 1711). 

[^76n2]: It was common practice for planters to send their children to Britain for education. Many of the children who were sent there, however, never returned to the Caribbean.  

[^f76n3]: The Thames river. Here, used to mean England.   

[^f76n4]: Eton, a prestigious English boarding school for boys founded in the fifteenth century. 

[^f76n5]: Egyptian goddess associated with agriculture and marriage. Isis was eventually apropriated into Greek and Roman mythology, becoming a common figure in eighteenth-century British poetry. In the context of these lines, Isis is used as a name for the Thames as it passes through Oxford. 

[^f76n6]: The nine muses of art, literature, and science.
