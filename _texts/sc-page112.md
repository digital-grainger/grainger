- Fraudful, their weight of sugar to increase.[^f112n1]
- Far be such guile from Britain's honest swains.
- Such arts, awhile, the unwary may surprise,
- And benefit the Impostor; but, ere long, [460]
- The skilful buyer will the fraud detect,
- And, with abhorrence, reprobate the name.

- FORTUNE had crown'd Avaro's[^f112n2] younger years,
- With a vast tract of land, on which the cane
- Delighted grew, nor ask'd the toil of art. [465]
- The Sugar-bakers deem'd themselves secure,
- Of mighty profit, could they buy his cades;
- For, whiteness, hardness, to the leeward-crop,
- His muscovado gave. But, not content
- With this pre-eminence of honest gain, [470]
- He baser sugars started in his casks;
- His own, by mixing fordid things, debas'd.
- One year the fraud succeeded; wealth immense
- Flowed in upon him, and he blest his wiles:
- The next, the brokers spurn'd the adulterate mass, [475]
- Both on the Avon and the banks of Thame.[^f112n3]

- BE thrifty, planter, even thy skimmings[^f112n4] save:
- For, planter, know, the refuse of the Cane

[^f112n1]: Grainger criticizes the French, whom he accuses of doctoring their sugar by adding sand to it.  

[^f112n2]: A mean-spirited, rich man who appears as a character in Richard Steele's *The Tatler* (1709-1711).

[^f112n3]: The Thames, another major site for sugar refining in the eighteenth century.  

[^f112n4]: The thick syrup or scum produced during the sugar-boiling step of refining.
