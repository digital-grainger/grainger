- Nor kill the winding ſnake, thy foes they eat.
- Thus, on the mangrove-banks[^f1] of Guayaquil,
- Child of the rocky deſert, ſea-like ﬅream,
- With ﬅudious care, the American preſerves

- Thy foes, the teeth-fil'd Ibbos[^f3] alſo love ;
- Nor thou their wayward appetite reﬅrain.

Nor is the male alligator leſs an enemy to the increaſe of his own horrid brood, than theſe uſeful birds ; for, when Inﬅinct prompts the female to let her young fry out by breaking the eggs, he never fails to accompany her, and to devour as many of them as he can: So that the mother ſcarce ever eſcapes into the river with more than five out of all her hundred. Thus providence doubly prevents the otherwiſe immenſe propagation of that voracious animal, on the banks of the river Guayaquil ; for the gallinazo is not always found, where alligators are. *Ullsa*.

[^f3]:
	Or *Ebbos*, as they are commonly called, are a numerous nation. Many of them have their teeth filed, and blackened in an extraordinary manner. They make good ſlaves when bought young; but are, in general[...]
