[136]()

- YET, planter, let humanity prevail.—
- Perhaps thy Negroe, in his native land,
- Possest large fertile plains, and slaves, and herds: <!--[Possest is in the original, as opposed to Possessed]-->
- Perhaps, whene'er he deign'd to walk abroad,
- The richest silks, from where the Indus rolls, [215]
- His limbs invested in their gorgeous pleats:
- Perhaps he wails his wife, his children, left
- To struggle with adversity: Perhaps
- Fortune, in battle for his country fought,
- Gave him a captive to his deadliest foe: [220]
- Perhaps, incautious, in his native fields,
- (On pleasurable scenes his mind intent)
- All as he wandered; from the neighbouring grove,
- Fell ambush dragg'd him to the hated main.—
- Were they even sold for crimes; ye polish'd, say! [225]
- Ye, to whom Learning opes her amplest page!
- Ye, whom the knowledge of a living God
- Should lead to virtue! Are ye free from crimes?
- Ah pity, then, these uninstructed swains;
- And still let mercy soften the decrees [230]
- Of rigid justice, with her lenient hand.

- OH, did the tender muse possess the power,
- Which monarchs have, and monarchs oft abuse:
