[64]()

- Feeds on the Indian fig; and, should it harm
- The foster plant, its worth that harm repays:
- But YE, base insects! no bright scarlet yield,
- To deck the British Wolf; who now, perhaps, [175]
- (So Heaven and George ordain) in triumph mounts
- Some strong-built fortress, won from haughty Gaul!
- And tho' no plant such luscious nectar yields,
- As yields the Cane-plant; yet, vile paricides!
- Ungrateful ye! the Parent-cane destroy. [180] 

- MUSE! say, what remedy hath skill devis'd
- To quell this noxious foe? Thy Blacks send forth,
- A strong detachment! ere the encreasing pest
- Have made too firm a lodgment; and, with care,
- Wipe every tainted blade, and liberal lave [185]
- With sacred Neptune's purifying stream.
- But this Augaean toil long tme demands,
- Which thou to more advantage may'st employ:
- If vows for rain thou ever did'st prefer,

> VER. 171. *Thus cochinille*\] This is a Spanish word. For the manner of propagating this useful insect, see Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica. It was long believed in Europe to be a seed, or vegetable production. The botanical name of the plant on which the cochinille feeds, is *Opuntia maxima*, *folio oblongo*, *majore*, *spinulis obtusis*, *mollibus et innocentibus obsito*, *flore*, *striis rubris variegato*.
