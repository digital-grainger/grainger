- Tho' mountains heapt on mountains brave the sky,
- Dares winter, by his residence, prophane.
- At times the ruffian, wrapt in murky state,
- Inroads will, sly, attempt; but soon the sun, [20]
- Benign protector of the Cane-land isles,
- Repells the invader, and his rude mace breaks.
- Here, every mountain, every winding dell,
- \(Haunt of the Dryads; where, beneath the shade
- Of broad-leaf'd china, idly they repose, [25]
