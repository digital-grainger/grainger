[98]()

- YET the faint breeze oft flags on listless wings,
- Nor tremulates the coco's airiest arch, [205]
- While the red sun darts deluges of fire;
- And soon \(if on the gale thy crop depend,\)
- Will all thy hopes of opulence defeat.

- "INFORMER of the planetary train!"
- Source undiminished of all-cheering light, [210]
- Of roseat beauty, and heart-gladning joy!
- Fountain of being, on whose water broods
- The organic spirit, principle of life!
- Lord of the seasons! who in courtly pomp
- Lacquay thy presence, and with glad dispatch, [215]
- Pour at thy bidding, o'ver the land and sea!
- Parent of Vegetation, whose fond grasp
- The Sugar-Cane displays; and whose green car
- Soft-stealing dews, with liquid pearls adorn'd,
- Fat-fostering rains, and buxom genial airs [220]
- Attend triumphant! Why, ah why so oft,
- Why hath Antigua, sweetly social isle,

> VER. 222. *Why hath Antigua*\] This beautiful island lies in 16 degrees and 14 min. N. lat. It was long uninhabited on account of its wanting fresh-water rivers; but is now more fully peopled, and as well cultivated as any of the leeward islands. In a seasonable year, it has made 30,000 hogsheads of sugar. It has no very high mountains. The soil is, in general, clayey. The water of the body-ponds may be used for every purpose of life. Antigua is well fortified, and has a good militia.
