- But independance: yet if thou, sweet maid,  
- In health and virtue bloom; tho' worse betide,  
- Thy smile will smoothe adversity's rough brow. [550]  

- IN Italy's green bounds, the myrtle shoots  
- A fragrant fence, and blossoms in the sun.  
- Here, on the rockiest verge of these blest isles,  
- With little care, the plant of love would grow. [555]  
- Then to the citron join the plant of love,  
- And with their scent and shade enrich your isles.  

- YET some pretend, and not unspecious they,  
- The wood-nymphs foster the contagious blast.[^f39n1]  
- Foes to the Dryads,[^f39n2] they remorseless fell [560]  
- Each shrub of shade, each tree of spreading root,  
- That woo the first glad fannings of the breeze.
- Far from the muse be such inhuman thoughts;
- Far better recks[^f39n3] she of the woodland tribes,  
- Earth's eldest birth, and earth's best ornament. [565]  
- Ask him, whom rude necessity compels  
- To dare the noontide fervor, in this clime,  
- Ah, most intensely hot; how much he longs  


> VER. 559. *contagious blast.*\] So a particular species of blight is called in the West-Indies. See its description in the second book.

[^f39n1]: Gilmore identifies the blast as the disease that also has been called the black blight. It results from an infestation by the West Indian cane fly (*Saccharosydne saccharivora*).

[^f39n2]: Wood or tree nymph in Greek mythology.

[^f39n3]: Heeds, cares, minds, considers.
