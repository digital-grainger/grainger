[39]()  

- But independance: yet if thou, sweet maid,  
- In health and virtue bloom; tho' worse betide,  
- Thy smile will smoothe adversity's rough brow. [550]  

- IN Italy's green bounds, the myrtle shoots  
- A fragrant fence, and blossoms in the sun.  
- Here, on the rockiest verge of these blest isles,  
- With little care, the plant of love would grow. [555]  
- Then to the citron join the plant of love,  
- And with their scent and shade enrich your isles.  

- YET some pretend, and not unspecious they,  
- The wood-nymphs foster the contagious blast.  
- Foes to the Dryads, they remorseless fell [560]  
- Each shrub of shade, each tree of spreading root,  
- That woo the first glad fannings of the breeze.  
- Far better recks she of the woodland tribes,  
- Earth's eldest birth, and earth's best ornament. [565]  
- Ask him, whom rude necessity compels  
- To dare the noontide fervor, in this clime,  
- Ah, most intensely hot; how much he longs
