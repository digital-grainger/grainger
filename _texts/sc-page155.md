[155]()

- Call'd water-lemon; grateful to the taste:
- Nor should she not pursue the mountain-streams, [545]
- But pleas'd decoy them from their shady haunts,
- In rills, to visit every tree and herb;
- Or fall o'er fern-clad cliffs, with foaming rage;
- Or in huge basons float, a fair expanse;
- Or, bound in chains of artificial force, [550]
- Arise thro' sculptured stone, or breathing brass.---
- But I'm in haste to furl my wind-worn sails,
- And anchor my tir'd vessel on the shore.

- IT much imports to build thy Negroe-huts,
- Or on the sounding margin of the main, [555]
- Or on some dry hill's gently-sloping sides,
- In streets, at distance due.——When near the beach,
- Let frequent coco cast its wavy shade;
- \'Tis Neptune's tree; and, nourish'd by the spray,
- Soon round the bending stem's aerial height, [560]
- Clusters of mighty nuts, with milk and fruit
- Delicious fraught, hang clattering in the sky.
- There let the bay-grape, too, its crooked limbs
