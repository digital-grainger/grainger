[105]()

- Thick mantles o'er the boiling wave, do thou
- The skum that mantles carefully remove.

- FROM bloating dropsy, from pulmonic ails,
- Would'st thou defend thy boilers, \(prime of slaves,\) [335]
- For days, for nights, for weeks, for months, involv'd
- In the warm vapour's all-relaxing steam;
- Thy boiling-house be lofty: all atop
- Open, and pervious to the tropic breeze;
- Whose cool perflation, wooed through many a grate, [340]
- Dispells the steam, and gives the lungs to play.

- THE skill'd in chemia, boast of modern arts,
- Know from experiment, the fire of truth,
- In many a plant that oil, and acid juice,
- And ropy mucilage, by nature live: [345]
- These, envious, stop the much desir'd embrace
- Of the essential salts, tho' coction bid
- The aqueous particles to mount in air.

- 'MONG salts essential, sugar wins the palm,
- For taste, for colour, and for various use: [350]
