[162]()

- And must for ever; still indulgent share [675]
- Her fostering smile: and other isles be given,
- From vanquish'd foes.â€”And, see, another race!
- A golden aera dazzles my fond sight! 
- That other race, that long'd-for aera, hail!
- THE BRITISH GEORGE NOW REIGNS, THE PATRIOT KING! [680]
- BRITAIN SHALL EVER TRIUMPH O'ER THE MAIN.

## The END of BOOK IV.
