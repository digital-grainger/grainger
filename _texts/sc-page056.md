[56]()  

- With these attack the predatory bands;  
- Quickly the unequal conflict they decline,  
- And, chattering, fling their ill-got spoils away.  
- So when, of late, innumerous Gallic hosts [55]  
- Fierce, wanton, cruel, did by stealth invade  
- The peaceable American's domains,  
- While desolation mark'd their faithless rout;  
- No sooner Albion's martial sons advanc'd,  
- Than the gay dastards to their forests fled, [60]  
- And left their spoils and tomahawks behind.  

- NOR with less waste the whisker'd vermine-race,  
- A countless clan, despoil the low-land Cane.  

- THESE to destroy, while commerce hoists the sail,  
- Loose rocks abound, or tangling bushes bloom, [65]  
- What Planter knows?â€”Yet prudence may reduce.  
- Encourage then the breed of savage cats,

> VER. 64. *These to destroy*\] Rats, *&c.* are not natives of America, but came by shipping from Europe. They breed in the ground, under loose rocks and bushes. Durante, a Roman, who was physician to Pope Sixtus Quintus, and who wrote a Latin poem on the preservation of health, enumerates domestic rats among animals that may be eaten with safety. But if these are wholesome, cane-rats must be much more delicate, as well as more nourishing. Accordingly we find most field Negroes fond of them, and I have heard that straps of cane-rats are publicly sold in the markets of Jamaica.
