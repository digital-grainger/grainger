[159]()

- To every Negroe, as the candle-weed
- Expands his blossoms to the cloudy sky,
- And moist Aquarius melts in daily showers; [615]
- A wooly vestment give, (this Wiltshire weaves)
- Warm to repel chill Night's unwholesome dews:
- While strong coarse linen, from the Scotian loom,
- Wards off the fervours of the burning day.

- THE truly great, tho' from a hostile clime, [620]
- The sacred Nine embalm; then, Muses, chant,
- In grateful numbers, Gallic Lewis' praise:
- For private murder quell'd; for laurel'd arts,
- Invented, cherish'd in his native realm;
- For rapine punish'd; for grim famine fed; [625]
- For sly chicane expell'd the wrangling bar;
- And rightful Themis seated on her throne:
- But, chief, for those mild laws his wisdom fram'd,
- To guard the AEthiop from tyrannic sway!

- DID such, in these green isles which Albion claims, [630]
- Did such obtain; the muse, at midnight-hour,
