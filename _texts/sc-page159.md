- To every Negroe, as the candle-weed[^f159n1]
- Expands his blossoms to the cloudy sky,
- And moist Aquarius[^f159n2] melts in daily showers; [615]
- A wooly vestment give, (this Wiltshire weaves)[^f159n3]
- Warm to repel chill Night's unwholesome dews:
- While strong coarse linen, from the Scotian loom,
- Wards off the fervours of the burning day.

- THE truly great, tho' from a hostile clime, [620]
- The sacred Nine embalm; then, Muses, chant,
- In grateful numbers, Gallic Lewis'[^f159n4] praise:
- For private murder quell'd; for laurel'd arts,
- Invented, cherish'd in his native realm;
- For rapine[^f159n5] punish'd; for grim famine fed; [625]
- For sly chicane[^f159n6] expell'd the wrangling bar;
- And rightful Themis[^f159n7] seated on her throne:
- But, chief, for those mild laws his wisdom fram'd,
- To guard the AEthiop from tyrannic sway![^f159n8]

- DID such, in these green isles which Albion[^f159n9] claims, [630]
- Did such obtain; the muse, at midnight-hour,


> VER. 613. *candle-weed*\] This shrub, which produces a yellow flower somewhat resembling a narcissus,[^f159n10] makes a beautiful hedge, and blows about November. It grows wild every where. It is said to be diuretic,[^f159n11] but this I do not know from experience.


[^f159n1]: *Senna alata*, also known today as the candle bush or king of the forest. Its native range is southwestern Mexico to the tropical Americas.  

[^f159n2]: Eleventh constellation of the zodiac, represented by a figure pouring water from a jar. The sun enters Aquarius in mid-January and exits it in mid-February.

[^f159n3]: Wiltshire, a county in England, has been a center of the English weaving and woolen industry for nearly 4000 years.

[^f159n8]: Grainger is referring to the *Code noir*, a royal edict issued by Louis XIV in 1685. The *Code noir* contained sixty articles regulating the treatment of the enslaved in the French Caribbean. Although Grainger praises it as protecting the enslaved from abuse, other eighteenth-century observers condemned it as proving the inhumanity of the institution of slavery, since it still allowed masters to inflict harsh punishments on the enslaved and treat them as property.
