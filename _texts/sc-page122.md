- Of use to mortal man, life to prolong,
- To soften, or adorn; what genuine joy,
- What exultation of supreme delight, [650]
- Will swell my raptured bosom. Then, when death
- Shall call me hence, I'll unrepining go;
- Nor envy conquerors their storied tombs,
- Tho' not a stone point out my humble grave.

The END of BOOK III.
