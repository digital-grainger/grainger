[30]()  

- To glad the thirsty soil on which, arrang'd,  
- The gemmy summits of the Cane await [395]  
- Thy Negroe-train, \(in linen lightly wrapt,\)  
- Who now that painted Iris girds the sky,  
- \(Aerial arch, which Fancy loves to stride!\)  
- Disperse, all-jocund, o'er the long-hoed land.  

- THE bundles some untie; the withered leaves, [400]  
- Others strip artful off, and careful lay,  
- Twice one junk, distant in the amplest bed:  
- O'er these, with hasty hoe, some lightly spread  
- The mounded interval; and smooth the trench:  
- Well-pleas'd, the master-swain reviews their toil; [405]  
- And rolls, in fancy, many a full-fraught cask.  
- So, when the shield was forg'd for Peleus' Son;  
- The swarthy Cyclops shar'd the important task:  
- With bellows, some reviv'd the seeds of fire;  
- Some, gold, and brass, and steel, together fus'd [410]  
- In the vast furnace; while a chosen few,  
- In equal measures lifting their bare arms,  
- Inform the mass; and, hissing in the wave,  
- Temper the glowing orb: their fire beholds,  
- Amaz'd, the wonders of his fusile art. [415]
