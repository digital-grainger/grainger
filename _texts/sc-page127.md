[127]()

- What care the jetty African requires? [35]
- Yes, thou wilt deign to hear; a man thou art
- Who deem'st nought foreign that belongs to man.

- IN mind, and aptitude for useful toil,
- The negroes differ: muse that difference sing.

- WHETHER to wield the hoe, or guide the plane; [40]
- Or for domestic uses thou intend'st
- The sunny Libyan: from what clime they spring,
- It not imports; if strength and youth be theirs.

- YET those from Congo's wide-extended plains,
- Through which the long Zaire winds with chrystal stream, [45]
- Where lavish Nature sends indulgent forth
- Fruits of high flavour, and spontaneous seeds
- Of bland nutritious quality, ill bear
- The toilsome field; but boast a docile mind,
- And happiness of features. These, with care, [50]
- Be taught each nice mechanic art: or train'd
- To houshold offices: their ductile souls
- Will all thy care, and all thy gold repay.

- BUT, if the labours of the field demand
