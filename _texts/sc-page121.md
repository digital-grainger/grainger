[121]()

- Leave Europe; there, through all her coyest ways, [625]
- Her secret mazes, nature is pursued:
- But here, with savage loneliness, she reigns
- On yonder peak, whence giddy fancy looks,
- Affrighted, on the labouring main below.
- Heavens! what stupendous, what unnumbered trees, [630]
- "Stage above stage, in various verdure drest,"
- Unprofitable shag its airy cliffs!
- Heavens! what new shrubs, what herbs with useless bloom,
- Adorn its channel'd sides; and, in its caves 
- What sulphurs, ores, what earths and stones abound! [635]
- There let philosphy conduct thy steps,
- "For naught is useless made:" With candid search,
- Examine all the properties of things;
- Immense discoveries soon will crown your toil,
- Your time will soon repay. Ah, when will cares, [640]
- The cares of Fortune, less my minutes claim?
- Then, with what joy, what energy of soul,
- Will I not climb yon mountain's airiest brow!
- The dawn, the burning noon, the setting sun,
- The midnight-hour, shall hear my constant vows [645]
- To Nature; see me prostrate at her shrine!
- And, O, if haply I may aught invent
