## THE SUGAR-CANE

### BOOK III.


- FROM scenes of deep distress, the heavenly Muse,
- Emerging joyous, claps her dewy wings.
- As when a pilgrim, in the howling waste,
- Hath long time wandered, fearful at each step,
- Of tumbling cliffs, fell serpents, whelming bogs; [5]
- At last, from some lone eminence, descries
- Fair haunts of social life; wide-cultur'd plains,[^f87n1]
- O'er which glad reapers pour; he chearly sings:
- So she to sprightlier notes her pipe attunes,
- Than e'er these mountains heard; to gratulate, [10]
- With duteous carols, the beginning year.

[^f87n1]: Cultivated fields.
