[102]()

- Await thy cattle! farcy's[^f102n1] tabid[^f102n2] form,
- Joint-racking spasms, and cholic's[^f102n3] pungent pang,
- Need the muse tell? which, in one luckless moon, [275]
- Thy sheds dispeople; when perhaps thy groves,
- To full perfection shot, by day, by night,
- Indesinent[^f102n4] demand their vigorous toil.

- THEN happiest he, for whom the Naiads[^f102n5] pour,
- From rocky urns, the never-ceasing stream, [280]
- To turn his rollers with unbought dispatch.

- IN Karukera's[^f102n6] rich well-water'd isle!
- In Matanina![^f102n7] boast of Albion's arms,
- The brawling Naiads for the planters toil,
- Howe'er unworthy; and, thro'[^f102n8] solemn scenes, [285]
- Romantic, cool, with rocks and woods between,
- Enchant the senses! but, among thy swains,
- Sweet Liamuiga![^f102n9] who such bliss can boast?
- Yes, Romney,[^f102n10] thou may'st boast; of British heart,
- Of courtly manners, join'd to antient worth: [290]
- Friend to thy Britain's every blood-earn'd right,
