[11]()

- Strow'd with each fruit of taste, each flower of smell, [65]
- Sicilian Proserpine, delighted, sought; 
- Can vie, blest Isle, with thee.—Tho' no soft sound
- Of pastoral stop thine echoes e'er awak'd;
- Nor raptured poet, lost in holy trance,
- Thy streams arrested with enchanting song: [70]
- Yet virgins, far more beautiful than she
- Whom Pluto ravish'd, and more chaste, are thine:
- Yet probity, from principle, not fear,
- Actuates thy sons, bold, hospitable, free:
- Yet a fertility, unknown of old, [75]
- To other climes denied, adorns thy hills;
- Thy vales, thy dells adorns.—O might my strain
- As far transcend the immortal songs of Greece,
- As thou the partial subject of their praise! [80]
- Thy fame should float familiar thro' the world;
- Each plant should own thy Cane her lawful lord;
- Nor should old Time, song stops the flight of Time,
- Obscure thy lustre with his shadowy wing.

- SCARCE less impregnated, with every power
- Of vegetation, is the red brick-mould, [85]
- That lies on marly beds.—The renter, this
- Can scarce exhaust; how happy for the heir!
