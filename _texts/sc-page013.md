- And where the magnet first its aid declin'd'
- Alone, unterrified, didst thou not view?
- Wise Legislator, had the Iberian King
- Thy plan adopted, murder had not drench'd
- In blood vast kingdoms; nor had hell-born Zeal, [115]
- And hell-born Avarice, his arms disgrac'd.
- Yet, for a world, discover'd and subdu'd,
- What meed had'st thou? With toil, disease, worn out,

>VER. 111. *and where the magnet*\] The declension of the needle was discovered, *A. D.* 1492, by Columbus, in his first voyage to America; and would have been highly alarming to any, but one of his undaunted and philosophical turn of mind.

>This century will always make a distinguished figure in the history of hte human mind; for, during that period printing was invented, Greek-learning took refuge in Italy, the Reformation began, and America was discovered.

>The island of Jamaica was bestowed on Columbus, as some compensation for his discovery of the new world; accordingly his son James settled, and planted it early [*A. D.* 1509] the following century. What improvements the Spaniards made therein is no where mentioned; but, had their industry been equal to their opportunities, their improvements should have been considerable; for they continued in the undisturbed possession of it till the year 1596, when Sir Anthony Shirley, with a single man of war, took and plundered St. Jago de la Vega, which then consisted of 2000 houses. In the year 1635, St. Jago de la Vega, which then consisted of 2000 houses. In the year 1635, St. Jago de la Vega was a second time plunered by 500 English from the Leeward islands, tho' that capital, and fort, (which they also took) were defended by four times their number of Spaniards. One and twenty years afterwards, the whole island was reduced by the forces sent thither by Oliver Cromwell, and has ever since belonged to England. It is by far the largest island possessed by the English in the West Indies. Sir Thomas Modyford, a rich and eminent planter of Barbadoes, removed to Jamaica *A. D.* 1660 to the great advantage of that island, for he instructed the young English settlers to cultivate the Sugar-cane; for which, and other great improvements which he then made them acquainted with, King Charles, three years afterwards, appointed him Governour thereof, in which honourable employment he continued till the year 1669.
