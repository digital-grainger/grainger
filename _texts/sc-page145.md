- FERN root cut small, and tied with many a knot;
- Old teeth extracted from a white man's skull;
- A lizard's skeleton; a serpent's head:
- These mix'd with salt, and water from the spring, [390]
- Are in a phial pour'd;[^f145n1] o'er these the leach
- Mutters strange jargon, and wild circles forms.

- Secure from poison; for to poison they
- Are infamously prone: and arm'd with this, [395]
- Their sable country daemons they defy,
- Who fearful haunt them at the midnight hour,
- To work them mischief. This, diseases fly;
- Diseases follow: such its wonderous power!
- This o'er the threshold of their cottage hung, [400]
- No thieves break in; or, if they dare to steal,
- Their feet in blotches, which admit no cure,
- Burst loathsome out: but should its owner filch,
- As slaves were ever of the pilfering kind,
- This from detection screens;â€”so conjurers swear. [405]

- 'TILL morning dawn, and Lucifer[^f145n2] withdraw
- His beamy chariot; let not the loud bell
