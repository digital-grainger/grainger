- \(Which nature to the soursop had resign'd,\)  
- With ginger, and with Raleigh's pungent plant,  
- Gave wealth; and gold bought better land and slaves. [600]  
- Heaven bless'd his labour: now the cotton-shrub,  
- Grac'd with broad yellow flowers, unhurt by worms,  
- O'er many an acre shed its whitest down:  
- The power of rain, in genial moisture bath'd  
- His cacao-walk, which teem'd with marrowy pods; [605]

> VER. 598. *to the soursop*\] The true Indian name of this tree is *Suirsaak*. It grows in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds. Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an acid. It is one of the *Ananas*, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples. The leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the West-Indies. The botanical name is *Guanabanus*. The French call it *Petit Corosol*, or *Coeur de Boeuf*, to which the fruit bears a resemblance. The root, being reduced to a powder, and snuffed up the nose, produces the same effect as tobacco. Taken by the mouth, the Indians pretend it is a specific in the epilepsy.

> VER. 601. *cotton*\] The fine down, which this shrub produces to invelope its seeds, is sufficiently known. The English, Italian, and French names, evidently are derived from the Arabic *Algodon*, as the Spaniards at this day call it. It was first brought by the Arabians into the Levant, where it is now cultivated with great success. Authors mention four species of cotton, but they confound the silk-cotton tree, or *Ceiba*, among them. The flower of the West-India cotton-shrub is yellow, and campanulated. It produces twice every year. That of Cayenne is the best of any that comes from America. This plant is very apt to be destroyed by a grub within a short time; bating that, it is a profitable production. Pliny mentions *Gossipium*, which is the common botanical name of cotton. It is likewise called *Zylon*. Martinus, in his Philological Lexicon, derives cotton from the Hebrew word &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; *Katon*, (or, as pronounced by the German-Jews, *Kotoun*.)
