- Thrice wholesome fruit in this relaxing clime!
- Safely thou may'st their appetite indulge.
- Their arid skins will plumb, their features shine: [140]
- No rheums, no dysenteric ails torment:
- The thirsty hydrops flies.——'Tis even averr'd, 
- (\Ah, did experience sanctify the fact;
- How many Lybians now would dig the soil,
- Who pine in hourly agonies away!\) [145]
- This pleasing fruit, if turtle joins its aid,
- Removes the worst of ails, disgrace of art,
- The loathsome leporsy's infectious bane.

- THERE are, the muse hath oft abhorrent seen,
- Who swallow dirt; (\so the chlorotic fair [150]

> the English. The fruit has no resemblance to a cherry, either in shape or size; and bears, at its lower extremity, a nut (\which the Spaniards name *Anacardo*, and physicians *Anacardium*) that resembles a large kidney-bean. Its kernel is as grateful as an almond, and more easy of digestion. Between its rhinds is contained a highly caustic oil; which, being held to a candle, emits bright salient sparkles, in which the American fortune-tellers pretended they saw spirits who gave answers to whatever questions were put to them by their ignorant followers. This oil is used as a cosmetic by the ladies, to remove freckles and sun-burning; but the pain they necessarily suffer makes it use not very frequent. This tree also produces a gum not inferior to Gum Arabic; and its bark is an approved astringent. The juice of the cherry stains exceedingly. The long citron, or amber-coloured, is the best. The cashew-nuts, when unripe, are of a green colour; but, ripe, they assume that of a pale olive. This tree bears fruit but once a year.
