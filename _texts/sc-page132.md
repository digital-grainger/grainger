- Thrice wholesome fruit in this relaxing clime!
- Safely thou may'st their appetite indulge.
- Their arid skins will plump, their features shine: [140]
- No rheums, no dysenteric ails torment:
- The thirsty hydrops flies.[^f132n1]â€”'Tis even averr'd, 
- (Ah, did experience sanctify the fact;
- How many Lybians now would dig the soil,
- Who pine in hourly agonies away!) [145]
- This pleasing fruit, if turtle[^f132n2] join its aid,
- Removes that worst of ails, disgrace of art,
- The loathsome leprosy's[^f132n3] infectious bane.

- THERE are, the muse hath oft abhorrent seen,
- Who swallow dirt;[^f132n4] (so the chlorotic fair[^f132n5] [150]

> the English. The fruit has no resemblance to a cherry, either in shape or size; and bears, at its lower extremity, a nut (which the Spaniards name *Anacardo*, and physicians *Anacardium*) that resembles a large kidney-bean. Its kernel is as grateful as an almond,[^f132n6] and more easy of digestion. Between its rhinds[^f132n7] is contained a highly caustic oil; which, being held to a candle, emits bright salient sparkles, in which the American fortune-tellers pretended they saw spirits who gave answers to whatever questions were put to them by their ignorant followers. This oil is used as a cosmetic by the ladies, to remove freckles and sun-burning; but the pain they necessarily suffer makes its use not very frequent. This tree also produces a gum not inferior to Gum-Arabic;[^f132n8] and its bark is an approved astringent. The juice of the cherry stains exceedingly. The long citron, or amber-coloured, is the best. The cashew-nuts, when unripe, are of a green colour; but, ripe, they assume that of a pale olive. This tree bears fruit but once a year.

[^f132n1]: The rheums refers to mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illnesses. Dysentery is a gastrointestinal disorder that remained a major public health concern throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Hydrops refers to an accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy. The modern term is edema (or oedema).  

[^f132n2]: Probably refers to the green turtle (*Chelonia mydas*), the only species of turtle indigenous to the Caribbean that has served as a significant food source for human beings.  

[^f132n3]: A chronic condition affecting the skin and nerves, caused by the microorganism *Mycobacterium leprae*.  

[^f132n4]: Geophagy or pica are the medical terms used for the practice of eating dirt. Eighteenth-century physicians and planters were fascinated with geophagy, which they believed to be a disorder that led to death. In certain instances, they posited that eating dirt was a means of committing suicide and thus a form of enslaved resistance.  

[^f132n5]: Chlorosis (also called green sickness) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

[^f132n6]: *Prunus dulcis*, primarily native to western Asia. 

[^f132n7]: The "Errata" list at the end of *The Sugar-Cane* indicates that "rhinds" should read "rinds."  

[^f132n8]: Edible sap of some trees in the genus *Acacia*. Used as a binder or stabilizer in foods and medicines.
