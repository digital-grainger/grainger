[90]()

- The ripened cane-piece; and, with her, to taste
- \(Delicious draught!\) the nectar of the mill! [45]

- THE planter's labour in a round revolves;
- Ends with the year, and with the year begins.

- YE swains, to Heaven bend low in grateful prayer,
- Worship the Almighty; whose kind-fostering hand
- Hath blest your labour, and hath given the cane [50]
- To rise superior to each menac'd ill.

- NOR less, ye planters, in devotion, sue,
- That nor the heavenly bolt, nor casual spark,
- Nor hand of malice may the crop destroy.

- AH me! what numerous, deafning bells, resound? [55]
- What cries of horror startle the dull sleep?
- What gleaming brightness makes, at midnight, day?
- By its portentuous glare, too well I see
- Palaemon's fate; the virtuous, and the wise!
- Where were ye, watches, when the flame burst forth? [60]
- A little care had then the hydra quell'd:
- But, now, what clouds of white smoke load the sky!
- How strong, how rapid the combustion pours!
