- And black crabs travel from the mountain down;
- Thy ducks their feathers prune; thy doves return,
- In faithful flocks, and, on the neighbouring roof,
- Perch frequent; where, with pleas'd attention, they [345]
- Behold the deepening congregated clouds,
- With sadness, blot the azure vault of heaven.

- NOW, while the shower depends, and rattle loud
- Your doors and windows, haste ye housewives, place
- Your spouts and pails; ye Negroes, seek the shade, [350]

>All of them are perfectly innocent. The Caribbeans used to eat them; they are not inferiour to snakes as a medicated food. Snuff forced into their mouth soon convulses them. They change colour, and become torpid; but, in a few hours, recover. The guana, or rather Iguana, is the largest sort of lizard. This, when irritated, will fly at one. It lives mostly upon fruit. It has a saw-like appearance, which ranges from its head all along its back, to its tail. The flesh of it is esteemed a great delicacy. The first writers on the *Lues Venerea*, forbid its use, to those who labour under that disease. It is a very ugly animal. In some parts of South-America, the alligator is called *Iguana*.

>VER. 342. *And black crabs*\] Black land-crabs are excellent eating; but as they sometimes will occasion a more violent *cholera morbus*, (owing, say planters, to their feeding on the mahoe-berry) they should never be dressed till they have fed for some weeks in a crab-house, after being caught by the Negroes. When they moult, they are most delicate; and then, it is believed, never poison. This however is certain, that at that time they have no gall, but, in its stead, the petrifaction called a Crabs-eye is found. As I have frequently observed their great claws (with whch they severely bite the unwary) of very unequal sizes, it is probable, these regenerate when broke off by accident, or otherwise.
