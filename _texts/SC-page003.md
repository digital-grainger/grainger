- What soil the Cane affects; what care demands;
- Beneath what signs to plant; what ills await;
- How the hot nectar best to christallize;
- And Afric’s sable progeny to treat:

- Of myrtle – indolence attempts to sing.

- Spirit of Inspiration, that didst lead 
- Th’ Ascrean Poet to the sacred Mount,
- And taught’st him all the precepts of the swain;
- \[10]Descend from Heaven, and guide my trembling steps 
- To Fame’s eternal Dome, where Maro reigns; 
- Where pastoral Dyer, where Pomona’s Bard,
- And Smart and Sommerville in varying strains,
