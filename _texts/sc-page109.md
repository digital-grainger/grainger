- But chief the sick and young, at setting day,
- Themselves regale with oft-repeated draughts [410]
- Of tepid Nectar; so shall health and strength
- Confirm thy Negroes, and make labour light.

- WHILE flame thy chimneys, while thy coppers foam,
- How blithe, how jocund, the plantation smiles!
- By day, by night, resounds the choral song [415]
- Of glad barbarity; serene, the sun
- Shines not intensely hot; the trade-wind blows:
- How sweet, how silken, is its noontide breath?
- While to far climes the fell destroyer, Death,
- Wings his dark flight. Then seldom pray for rain: [420]
- Rather for cloudless days thy prayers prefer;
