[109]()

- THE fam'd Bermuda's[^f109n1] ever-healthy isles,
- More fam'd by gentle Waller's[^f109n2] deathless strains,
- Than for their cedars,[^f109n3] which, insulting, fly
- O'er the wide ocean; 'mid their rocks contain
- A stone, which, when calcin'd, (experience says,) [405]
- Is only second to Sabrina's lime.

- WHILE flows the juice mellifluent from the Cane,
- Grudge not, my friend, to let thy slaves, each morn,
- But chief the sick and young, at setting day,
- Themselves regale with oft-repeated draughts [410]
- Of tepid Nectar; so shall health and strength
- Confirm thy Negroes, and make labour light.

- WHILE flame thy chimneys, while thy coppers foam,
- How blithe, how jocund, the plantation smiles!
- By day, by night, resounds the choral song [415]
- Of glad barbarity; serene, the sun
- Shines not intensely hot; the trade-wind[^f109n4] blows:
- How sweet, how silken, is its noontide breath?
- While to far climes the fell destroyer, Death,
- Wings his dark flight. Then seldom pray for rain: [420]
- Rather for cloudless days thy prayers prefer;

[^f109n1]: Bermuda was colonized by the English in the early seventeenth century and is now an overseas territory of Britain in the north Atlantic. 

[^f109n2]: Edmund Waller (1606-1687), English poet and politician and author of "The Battle of the Summer Islands" (1645), a mock-heroic set in Bermuda.

[^f109n3]: The Bermuda cedar (*Juniperus bermudiana*) is native to Bermuda and was used by early colonists as building material and fuel. By the 1830s, the ship-building industry had denuded Bermuda of most of its indigenous cedars. It is still a critically endangered species.

[^f109n4]: The prevailing wind patterns that eighteenth-century navigators used to sail their ships around the world. In the North Atlantic, the trade winds blow westerly from the coast of Africa just above the equator to the Caribbean and northeasterly from Florida up the coast of North America and toward Europe.
