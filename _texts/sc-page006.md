- Roll'd numerous on the Bay, all fully fraught
- With strong-grain'd muscovado, silvery-grey,
- Joy of the planter; and if happy Fate [30]
- Permit a choice: avoid the rocky slope,
- The clay-cold bottom, and the sandy beach. 
- But let thy biting ax with ceaseless stroke
- The wild red cedar,[^f6n1] the tough locust[^f6n2] fell:

> of coming in for a share of the sugar-trade; accordingly they, renouncing their chimerical search after gold mines in Florida and Guiana,[^f6n3] settled themselves soon after at the mouth of the river Surinam, where they cultivated the Cane with such success, that when the colony was ceded to the Dutch by the treaty of Breda,[^f6n4] it maintained not less than 40,000 Whites, half that number of slaves, and employed one year with another 15,000 ton of shipping. This cession was a severe blow to the English-trade, which it did not recover for several years, though many of the Surinam Planters carried their art and Negroes to the Leeward Islands[^f6n5] and Jamaica, which then began to be the object of political consideration in England.  

> Sugar is twice mentioned by Chaucer,[^f6n6] who flourished in the fourteenth century; and succeeding poets, down to the middle of the last, use the epithet *Sugar'd*, whenever they would express any thing uncommonly pleasing: since that time, the more elegant writers seldom admit of that adjective in a metaphorical sense; but herein perhaps they are affectedly squeamish. 

> VER. 29. *Muscovado,*\] The Cane-juice being brought to the consistence of syrup, and, by subsequent coction, granulated, is then called *muscovado* \(a Spanish word probably, though not to be found in Pineda) vulgarly brown Sugar; the French term it *sucre brut*.

> VER. 34. *wild red Cedar*\] There are two species of Cedar commonly to be met with in the West-Indies, the white and red, which differ from the cedars cultivated in the Bermudas: both are lofty, shady, and of quick growth. The white succeeds in any soil, and produces a flower which, infused like tea, is useful against fish poison. The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain. The wood of both are highly useful for many mechanical purposes, and but too little planted.

> VER. 34. *Locust*\] This is also a lofty tree. It is of quick growth and handsome, and produces a not disagreeable fruit in a flat pod or legumen, about three inches long. It is a serviceable wood. In botanical books, I find three different names for the locust-tree; that meant here is the *Siliqua edulis*.

[^f6n1]: Most likely *Cedrela odorata*, an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. Now considered vulnerable due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.

[^f6n2]: The locust bean tree or carob tree (*Ceratonia siliqua*) is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey but now spread widely over the world. It is the source of carob, which is used in food applications, including as a chocolate substitute.

[^f6n3]: Aggregate name for the colonies located along the northern coast of South America between the mouth of the Orinoco River (in modern Venezuela) and the mouth of the Amazon (in Brazil). Also included parts of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Colonizers included Portugal, France, the Netherlands, England, and Spain.

[^f6n4]: The treaty of Breda (1667) concluded the Anglo-Dutch War between England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark. The treaty formalized a major reorganization of colonial power, with the English taking control of New York, New Jersey, Antigua, and Montserrat; the Dutch gaining control of Surinam; and the French reclaiming Acadia in Atlantic Canada. Significantly for *The Sugar-Cane*, the treaty restored the French and British partition of St. Kitts.

[^f6n5]: Leeward is a nautical term meaning sheltered from the wind (i.e., downwind). The Leeward Islands include the British and US Virgin Islands, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Barth√©lemy, Barbuda, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Dominica.

[^f6n6]: Geoffrey Chaucer (1340-1400), author of *The Canterbury Tales*. Gilmore notes that Chaucer uses sugar twice in *The Canterbury Tales* and again in *Troilus and Criseyde*.
