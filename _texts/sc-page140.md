[140]()

- YET, of the ills which torture Libya's sons, [290]
- Worms tyrannize the worst. They, Proteus-like,
- Each symptom of each malady assume;
- And, under every mask, the assassins kill.
- Now in the guise of horrid spasms, they writhe
- The tortured body, and all sense o'er-power. [295]
- Sometimes, like Mania, with her head downcast,
- They cause the wretch in solitude to pine;
- Or frantic, bursting from the strongest chains,
- To frown with look terrific, not his own.
- Sometimes like Ague, with shivering mien, [300]
- The teeth gnash fearful, and the blood runs chill:
- Anon the ferment maddens in the veins,
- And a false vigour animates the frame.
- Again, the dropsy's bloated mask they steal;
- Or, "melt with minings of the hectic fire." [305]

- SAY, to such various mimic forms of death;
- What remedies shall puzzled art oppose?—
- Thanks to the Almighty, in each path-way hedge,
- Rank cow—itch grows, whose sharp unnumber'd stings,
- Sheath'd in Melasses, from their dens expell, [310]
- Fell dens of death, the reptile lurking foe.—
