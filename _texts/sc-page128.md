[128]()

- Thy chief attention; and the ambrosial cane [55]
- Thou long'st to see, with spiry frequence, shade
- Many an acre: planter, chuse the slave,
- Who sails from barren climes; where art alone,
- Offspring of rude necessity, compells
- The sturdy native, or to plant the soil, [60]
- Or stem vast rivers for his daily food.

- SUCH are the children of the Golden Coast;
- Such the Papaws, of negroes far the best:
- And such the numerous tribes, that skirt the shore,
- From rapid Volta to the distant Rey. [65]

- BUT, planter, from what coast foe'er they sail,
- Buy not the old: they ever sullen prove;
- With heart-felt anguish, they lament their home;
- They will not, cannot work; they never learn
- Thy native language; they are prone to ails; [70]
- And oft by suicide their being end.—

- MUST thou from Africk reinforce thy gang?—
- Let health and youth their every sinew firm;
- Clear roll their ample eye; their tongue be red;
- Broad swell their chest; their shoulders wide expand; [75]
