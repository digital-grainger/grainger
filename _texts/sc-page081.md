[81]()

- Like clouds dim rising in the distant sky. [500]
- Glad Eurus whistles; laugh the sportive crew;
- Each sail is set to catch the favouring gale,
- While on the yard-arm the harpooner sits,
- Strikes the boneta, or the shark insnares.
- The little nautilus with purple pride [505]
- Expands his sails, and dances o'er the waves:
- Small winged fishes on the shrouds alight;
- And beauteous dolphins gently played around.

> VER. 504. *The boneta*\] This fish, which is equal in size to the largest salmon, is only to be found in the warm latitudes. It is not a delicate food, but those who have lived for any length of time on salt meats at sea, do not dislike it. Sir Hans Sloane, in his voyage to Jamaica, describes the method of striking them.

> VER. 504. *Or the shark*\] This voracious fish needs no description; I have seen them from 15 to 20 foot long. Some naturalists call it *Canis Carharias*. They have been known to follow a slave-ship from Guinea to the West Indies. They swim with incredible celerity, and are found in some of the warmer seas of Europe, as well as between the tropics.

> VER. 505. *nautilus*\] This fish the seamen call a Portugese man of war. It makes a most beautiful appearance on the water.

> VER. 507. *winged fishes*\] This extraordinary species of fish is only found in the warm latitudes. Being pursued in the water by a fish of prey called Albacores, they betake themselves in shoals to flight, and in the air are often snapt up by the Garayio, a sea fowl. They sometimes fall on the shrouds or decks of ships. They are well tasted, and commonly sold at Barbadoes.

> VER. 508. *Dolphins*\] This is a most beautiful fish, when first taken out of the sea; but its beauty vanishes, almost as soon as it is dead.
