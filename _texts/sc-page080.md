[80]()

- TWICE one long year elaps'd, when letters came [480]
- Which briefly told him of his father's death.
- Afflicted, filial, yet to Heaven resign'd,
- Soon he reach'd Albion, and as soon embark'd,
- Eager to clasp the object of his love.

- BLOW, prosperous breezes; swiftly sail, thou Po: [485]
- Swift sail'd the Po, and happy breezes blew.

- IN Biscay's stormy seas an armed ship,
- Or force superiour, from loud Charente's wave
- Clapt them on board. The frighted flying crew
- Their colours strike; when dauntless Junior, sir'd [490]
- With noble indignation, kill'd the chief,
- Who on the bloody deck dealt slaughter round.
- The Gauls retreat; the Britons loud huzza;
- And touch'd with shame, with emulation stung,
- So plied their cannon, plied their missil fires, [495]
- That soon in air the hapless Thunderer blew.

- BLOW prosperous breezes, swiftly sail thou Po,
- May no more dangerous fights retard thy way!

- SOON Porto Santo's rocky heights they spy,
