- SOME place decoys, nor will they not avail,
- Replete with roasted crabs, in every grove
- These fell marauders gnaw; and pay their slaves
- Some small reward for every captive foe. [80]
- So practice Gallia's sons; but Britons trust
- In other wiles; and surer their success.

- WITH Misnian arsenic, deleterious bane,
- Pound up the ripe cassada's well-rasp'd root,
- And form in pellets; these profusely spread [85]
- Round the Cane-groves, where sculk the vermin-breed:
- They, greedy, and unweeting of the bait,
- Crowd to the inviting cates, and swift devour
- Their palatable Death; for soon they seek
- The neighbouring spring; and drink, and swell, and die. [90]
- But dare not thou, if life deserve thy care,
- The infected rivulet taste; nor let thy herds

> VER. 76. *Nor thou their wayward*\] Pere Labat says that Cane-rats give those Negroes who eat them pulmonic disorders, but the good Jesuit was no physician. I have been told by those who have eat them, that they are very delicate food.
