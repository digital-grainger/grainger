[7]()

- Nor let his nectar, nor his silken pods, [35]
- The sweet-smell'd cassia, or vast ceiba save.
- Yet spare the guava, yet the guaiac spare;
- A wholesome food the ripened guava yields,
- Boast of the houswife; while the guaiac grows
- A sovereign antidote, in wood, bark, gum, [40]
- To cause the lame his useless crutch forego,
- And dry the sources of corrupted love.
- Nor let thy bright impatient flames destroy

>VER. 36. *or vast ceiba save.*\]\ Canoes have been scooped out of this tree, capable of holding upwards of a hundred people; and many hundreds, as authors relate, have been sheltered by its shade. Its pods contain a very soft short cotton, like silk: hence the English call the tree the Silk-cotton-tree; and the Spaniards name its cotton *Lana de ceiba*. It has been wrought into stockings; but its commonest use is to stuff pillows and mattrasses. It might be made an article of commerce, as the tree grows without trouble, and is yearly covered with pods. An infusion of the leaves is a gentle diaphoretic, and much recommended in the small-pox. the botanical name of the ceiba is *Bombax*; and the French call it *Fromager*. There are two species; the stem of the one being prickly, and that of the other smooth.

>VER. 37. *Yet spare the guava,*\]\ The Spaniards call this tree *guayava*. It bears a fruit as large, and of much the same shape as a golden pippen. This is of three species, the yellow, the amazon, and the white; the last is the most delicate, but the second sort the largest: All are equally wholesome, when stewed or made into jelly, or marmalade. When raw, they are supposed to generate worms. Strangers do not always at first like their flavour, which is peculiarly strong. This, however, goes off by use, and they become exceedingly agreeable. Acosta says the Peruvian guavas surpass those of any other part of America. The bark of the tree is an astringent, and tanns leather as well as that of oak. The French call the tree *Goyavier*.

> VER. 37. â€”*yet the guaiac spare;* \]\ The lignum-vitae, or pockwood-tree. The virtues of every part of this truly medical tree are too well known to be enumerated here. The hardness and incorruptibility of its timber make abundant amends fo the great slowness of its growth, for of it are formed the best posts for houses against hurricanes, and it is no less usefully employed in building wind-mills and cattle-mills.
