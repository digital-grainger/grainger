[8]()

- The golden shaddoc, the forbidden fruit,
- The white acajou, and rich sabbaca: \[45]
- For, where these trees their leafy banners raise
- Aloft in air, a grey deep earth abounds,
- Fat, light; yet, when it feels the wounding hoe, 
- Rising in clods, which ripening suns and rain
- Resolve to crumbles, yet not pulverize: \[50]
- In this the soul of vegetation wakes, 
- Pleas'd at the planter's call, the burst on day.

- Thrice happy he, to whom such fields are given!
- For him the Cane with little labour grows;

> VER. 44. *The golden shaddoc*,\] This is the largest and finest kind of orange. It is not a native of America, but was brought to the islands, from the East-Indies, by an Englishman, whose name it bears. It is of three kinds, the sweet, the sour, and the bitter; the juice of all of them is wholesome, and the rind medical. In flavour and wholesomeness, the sweet shaddoc excels the other two, and indeed every other kind of orange, except the forbidden fruit, which scarce yields to any known fruit in the four quarters of the world. 

> VER. 45. *sabbaca*:\] This is the Indian name of the avocato, avocado, avigato, or, as the English corruptly call it, alligator-pear. The Spaniards in South-America name it *aguacate*, and under that name it is described by Ulloa. However, in Peru and Mexico, it is better known by the appellation of *palta* or *palto*. It is a sightly tree, of two species; the one bearing a green fruit, which is the most delicate, and the other a red, which is less esteemed, and grows chiefly in Mexico. When ripe, the skin peels easily off, and discovers a butyraceous, or rather a marrowy like substance, with greenish veins interspersed. Being eat with salt and pepper, or sugar and lime-juice, it is not only agreeable, but highly nourishing; hence Sir Hans Sloane used to stile it Vegetable marrow. The fruit is of the size and shape of the pear named Lady's-thighs, and contains a large stone, from whence the tree is propagated. These trees bear fruit but once a year. Few strangers care for it; but, by use, soon become fond of it. The juice of the kernel marks linen with a violet-colour. Its wood is soft, and consequently of little use. The French call it *Bois d' anise*, and the tree *Avocat*: the botanical name is *Persea*.
