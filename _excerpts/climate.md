## Climate  

The tropical climate of the West Indian islands can broadly be divided into the wet season of the summer months and the dry season of the winter months. The warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea determine a general equability of temperature across the region, with maximum temperatures rarely rising above 100°F/38°C. Such a climate enabled colonial cane cultivation on a widespread scale in the eighteenth century. Topographical variabilities such as mountainous areas, however, contribute to differences in rainfall, which increases in amount with altitude. Unsurprisingly, periods of greatest rainfall coincide with the hurricane season, which falls between June and November, and peaks in August and September. During such months, up to twenty inches of rain may fall within the span of two or three days, and strong winds are apt to cause significant damage. Such tempests in Grainger's poem cause dread for the planter, who is advised by the poet to "Remark the various signs of future rain" with "curious ken" (I.311-312). As the environment itself seems to resist mastery in *The Sugar-Cane*, the planter cannot afford to relax in his attention to the tropical environment.

For both the reader and the planter within the poem, attunement to changes in the weather fosters a heightened awareness of the animal and vegetal communities that exist alongside humans. When storms occur, humans, animals, and plants alike find themselves in vulnerability, as can be seen in the portions of Book I excerpted below. Countervailing the colonial narrative of human domination, Grainger's extensive passages on climate conditions illuminate how the human and the nonhuman elements overlap in a state of mutual exposure within the Caribbean ecology. 

Grainger continues to emphasize uncontrollable weather conditions as a source of anxiety for the planter in Book II, in which he spends one hundred and ten lines (II.270-380)—almost a fifth of the entire book—describing the effects of a hurricane. In order to consider why he sees fit to give so much space to depicting a hurricane, all one hundred and ten lines have been excerpted here. When reading about storms and hurricanes, it is worth thinking about the poet's anxieties as well as the planter's, by asking: how does Grainger manage the tension between the limits and the capacities of language to render overwhelming environmental circumstances? And how does Grainger deploy poetic technologies to create sensory immersion in the New World? What new affective ranges come into experience under such extreme circumstances, either expanding or contracting the emotional landscape of the plantation?  

By way of an interesting comparison to Grainger's preoccupations with seasonal rains, we may observe that another major eighteenth-century text on sugar cultivation, Colonel Samuel Martin's popular *An Essay on Plantership*, dispenses with discussions of climate. In this treatise on the effective management of a plantation, Martin, an Antiguan-born British planter, elaborates on different types of soil to be found in the British sugar colonies and the best months in which to plant and harvest cane. But even as he comments that there "is not ... a greater error in the whole practice of plantership, than to make sugar, or to plant canes at improper seasons of the year," Martin glosses over the disruptive power of the climate and omits any detail of "the destruction \[caused\] by hurricanes" (Martin 18). This choice places stress on the agency of the planter and his administrative practices, downplaying the effect of environmental contingencies. How, then, might we take *The Sugar-Cane*'s resolute commitment to the material realities of its specific Caribbean context? How does such a choice situate his text, at the nexus of poetry and natural history?

- And with fell rage the stranger-guest assail, [335]
- Nor spare the sportive child; from their retreats
- Cockroaches crawl displeasingly abroad:
- These, without pity, let thy slaves destroy;
- \(Like Harpies,[^f26n1] they defile whate'er they touch:)
- While those, the smother of combustion quells. [340]
- The speckled lizard to its hole retreats,

> VER. 334. *sand-flies,*\] This insect the Spaniards call *Mosquitilla*, being much smaller than the Mosquito. Its bite is like a spark of fire, falling on the skin, which it raises into a small tumour accompanied with itching. But if the sand-fly causes a sharper and more sudden pain than the Mosquito, yet it is a more honourable enemy, for remaining upon the skin after the puncture, it may easily be killed. Its colour is grey and black, striped. Lemon-juice or first runnings cure its bite.

> VER. 337. *Cockroaches crawl*\] This is a large species of the chafer, or scaribaeus, and is a most disagreeable as well as destructive insect. There is scarce any thing which it will not devour, and wherever it has remained for any time, it leaves a nauseous smell behind it. Though better than an inch long, their thickness is no ways correspondent, so that they can insinuate themselves almost through any crevise, *&c*. into cabinets, drawers, *&c*. The smell of cedar is said to frighten them away, but this is a popular mistake, for I have often killed them in presses of that wood. There is a species of Cockroach, which, on account of a beating noise which it makes, especially in the night, is called the Drummer.[^f26n2] Though larger, it is neither of so burnished a colour, nor so quick in its motions as the common sort, than which it is also less frequent, and not so pernicious; yet both will nibble peoples toe-ends, especially if not well washed, and have sometimes occasioned uneasy sores there. They are natives of a warm climate. The French call them *Ravets*.

> VER. 341. *the speckled lizard*\] This is meant of the ground-lizard, and not of the tree-lizard, which is of a fine green colour. There are many kinds of ground-lizards, which, as they are common in the hot parts of Europe, I shall not describe.   

[^f26n1]: Creatures in Greek mythology depicted as winged women or birds with women's faces.

[^f26n2]: *Blaberus discoidalis*.

- And black crabs travel from the mountain down;[^f27n1]
- Thy ducks their feathers prune; thy doves return,
- In faithful flocks, and, on the neighbouring roof,
- Perch frequent; where, with pleas'd attention, they [345]
- Behold the deepening congregated clouds,
- With sadness, blot the azure vault of heaven.

- NOW, while the shower depends, and rattle loud
- Your doors and windows, haste ye housewives, place
- Your spouts and pails; ye Negroes, seek the shade, [350]
- Save those who open with the ready hoe
- The enriching water-course: for, see, the drops,

>All of them are perfectly innocent. The Caribbeans used to eat them; they are not inferiour to snakes as a medicated food. Snuff forced into their mouth soon convulses them. They change colour, and become torpid; but, in a few hours, recover. The guana, or rather Iguana,[^f27n2] is the largest sort of lizard. This, when irritated, will fly at one. It lives mostly upon fruit. It has a saw-like appearance, which ranges from its head all along its back, to its tail. The flesh of it is esteemed a great delicacy. The first writers on the *Lues Venerea*,[^f27n3] forbid its use, to those who labour under that disease. It is a very ugly animal. In some parts of South-America, the alligator[^f27n4] is called *Iguana*.

>VER. 342. *And black crabs*\] Black land-crabs are excellent eating; but as they sometimes will occasion a most violent *cholera morbus*,[^f27n5] (owing, say planters, to their feeding on the mahoe-berry[^f27n6]) they should never be dressed till they have fed for some weeks in a crab-house, after being caught by the Negroes. When they moult, they are most delicate; and then, it is believed, never poison. This however is certain, that at that time they have no gall, but, in its stead, the petrifaction called a Crabs-eye is found. As I have frequently observed their great claws (with which they severely bite the unwary) of very unequal sizes, it is probable, these regenerate when broke off by accident, or otherwise.

[^f27n1]: Probably *Gecarcinus ruricola*, also known as the black land crab. One of several species of terrestrial or land crabs, the black land crab lives in damp and shaded forest areas inland and migrates in large numbers to the sea to breed. It is one of the most commonly exploited land crabs for human consumption in the Caribbean. Eighteenth-century observers were often fascinated by the mass migration of land crabs.  

[^f27n2]: A family of crested lizards (order Squamata, suborder Sauria). More than seven hundred species have been identified; they are found principally in the temperate and tropical Americas. Their flesh and eggs are valued for food.  

[^f27n3]: *Lues venerea* was the medical term used for syphilis (also commonly known by the British as the "French pox"). There were no effective treatments for syphilis until the early twentieth century. 

[^f27n4]: The American alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*.  

[^f27n5]: *Cholera morbus* is used in modern medicine to describe the water-borne disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*. In the eighteenth century, however, it described a variety of illnesses with symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal pain. 

[^f27n6]: May be the berries from the blue mahoe (*Hibiscus elatus*), a tree whose native range is Cuba and Jamaica. Also naturalized to other parts of the Caribbean; now the national tree of Jamaica.

- Which fell with slight aspersion, now descend
- In streams continuous on the laughing land.
- The coyest Naiads[^f28n1] quit their rocky caves, [355]
- And, with delight, run brawling to the main;
- While those, who love still visible to glad
- The thirsty plains from never-ceasing urns,
- Assume more awful majesty, and pour,
- With force resistless, down the channel'd rocks. [360]
- The rocks, or split, or hurried from their base,
- With trees, are whirl'd impetuous to the sea:
- Fluctuates the forest; the torn mountains roar:
- The main itself recoils for many a league,
- While its green face is chang'd to sordid brown. [365]
- A grateful freshness every sense pervades;
- While beats the heart with unaccustom'd joy:
- Her stores fugacious[^f28n2] Memory now recalls;
- And Fancy prunes her wings for loftiest flights.
- The mute creation share the enlivening hour; [370]
- Bounds the brisk kid, and wanton plays the lamb.
- The drooping plants revive; ten thousand blooms,
- Which, with their fragrant scents, perfume the air,
- Burst into being; while the Canes put on
- Glad Nature's liveliest robe, the vivid green. [375]

[^f28n1]: Nymphs of springs, rivers, and lakes in Greek mythology.  

[^f28n2]: Fugitive, fleeting, transient.

- SAY, can the Muse, the pencil in her hand, [270]
- The all-wasting hurricane observant ride?[^f69n1]
- Can she, undazzled, view the lightning's glare,
- That fires the welkin?[^f69n2] Can she, unappall'd,
- When all the flood-gates of the sky are ope,
- The shoreless deluge stem? The Muse hath seen [275]
- The pillar'd flame, whose top hath reach'd the stars;
- Seen rocky, molten fragments, flung in air
- From AEtna's[^f69n3] vext abyss; seen burning streams
- Pour down its channel'd sides; tremendous scenes!——
- Yet not vext AEtna's pillar'd flames, that strike [280]
- The stars; nor molten mountains hurl'd on high;
- Nor ponderous rapid deluges, that burn
- Its deeply-channel'd sides: cause such dismay,
- Such desolation, Hurricane! as thou;
- When the Almighty gives thy rage to blow, [285]
- And all the battles of thy winds engage.

- SOON as the Virgin's charms ingross the Sun;
- And till his weaker flame the Scorpion feels;
- But, chief, while Libra weighs the unsteddy year:[^f69n4]
- Planter, with mighty props thy dome[^f69n5] support; [290]
- Each flaw repair; and well, with massy bars,

[^f69n1]: In a 5 June 1762 letter to his friend Bishop Thomas Percy, Grainger notes that he had almost finished writing *The Sugar-Cane* and that this set-piece on the hurricane was one of the last sections that needed to be completed: "You may remember I some time ago mentioned my being engaged in a work of some length and difficulty. Lately I completed it, at least for the present, though no less than a Georgic, and in four books too. It is called the 'Cane Piece,' and was composed mostly in my rides to the different parts of the island to visit my patients. I now send you the whole; only as I have seen no hurricane, and have not yet had time to arrange my remarks on a fire by night in a cane field, those parts in the second book are incomplete" (Nichols 278).

[^f69n2]: welkin. Sky, firmament.

[^f69n3]: Etna, Europe's highest active volcano, located in Sicily.

[^f69n4]: Grainger is using astrological signs to designate peak hurricane season. The Virgin names Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-August and exits it in mid-September. Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-September and exits it in mid-October. Scorpio is the eight sign of the zodiac; the sun enters it in mid-October and exits it in mid-November. 

[^f69n5]: House.

- Thy doors and windows guard; securely lodge
- Thy stocks and mill-points.—Then, or calms obtain;
- Breathless the royal palm-tree's airiest van;[^f70n1]
- While, o'er the panting isle, the daemon Heat [295]
- High hurls his flaming brand; vast, distant waves
- The main drives furious in, and heaps the shore
- With strange productions: Or, the blue serene
- Assumes a louring[^f70n2] aspect, as the clouds
- Fly, wild-careering, thro' the vault of heaven; [300]
- Then transient birds, of various kinds, frequent
- Each stagnant pool; some hover o'er thy roof;
- Then Eurus reigns no more; but each bold wind,
- By turns, usurps the empire of the air
- With quick inconstancy; [305]
- Thy herds, as sapient[^f70n3] of the coming storm,
- (For beasts partake some portion of the sky,)
- In troops associate; and, in cold sweats bath'd,
- Wild-bellowing, eye the pole.[^f70n4] Ye seamen, now,
- Ply to the southward, if the changeful moon, [310]
- Or, in her interlunar palace hid,

> VER. 293. *stocks and mill-points:*\] The sails are fastened to the mill-points, as those are to the stocks. They should always be taken down before the hurricane-season.

[^f70n1]: Van is a vantage, height, or summit. The royal palm (*Roystonea oleracea*) can reach forty meters in height and is native to the Lesser Antilles, northern South America, and Guatemala.

[^f70n2]: Scowling, angry-looking, gloomy.

[^f70n3]: Knowledgeable.

[^f70n4]: Polaris, the pole star or North Star.

- Shuns night; or, full-orb'd, in Night's forehead glows:
- For, see! the mists, that late involv'd the hill,
- Disperse; the midday-sun looks red; strange burs
- Surround the stars, which vaster fill the eye. [315]
- A horrid stench the pools, the main emits;
- Fearful the genius of the forest sighs;
- The mountains moan; deep groans the cavern'd cliff.
- A night of vapour, closing fast around,
- Snatches the golden noon.—Each wind appeas'd, [320]
- The North flies forth, and hurls the frighted air:
- Not all the brazen engineries[^f71n1] of man,
- At once exploded, the wild burst surpass.
- Yet thunder, yok'd with lightning and with rain,
- Water with fire, increase the infernal din: [325]
- Canes, shrubs, trees, huts, are whirl'd aloft in air.——
- The wind is spent; and "all the isle below
- "Is hush as death."[^f71n2]
- Soon issues forth the West, with sudden burst;
- And blasts more rapid, more resistless drives: [330]


> VER. 314. *strange burs*\] These are astral halos. Columbus soon made himself master of the signs that precede a hurricane in the West-Indies, by which means he saved his own squadron; while another large fleet, whose commander despised his prognostics, put to sea, and was wrecked.


[^f71n1]: Engines of war, artillery. 

[^f71n2]: According to Gilmore, an approximate quotation of "and the orb below/As hush as death" (Shakespeare, *Hamlet* 2.2.485-486).

- Rushes the headlong sky; the city rocks;
- The good man throws him on the trembling ground;
- And dies the murderer in his inmost soul.—
- Sullen the West withdraws his eager storms.——
- Will not the tempest now his furies chain? [335]
- As, no! as when in Indian forests, wild,
- Barbaric armies suddenly retire
- After some furious onset, and, behind
- Vast rocks and trees, their horrid forms conceal,
- Brooding on slaughter, not repuls'd; for soon [340]
- Their growing yell the affrighted welkin rends,
- And bloodier carnage mows th' ensanguin'd plain:
- So the South, sallying from his iron caves
- With mightier force, renews the aerial war;
- Sleep, frighted, flies; and, see! yon lofty palm, [345]
- Fair nature's triumph, pride of Indian groves,
- Cleft by the sulphurous bolt! See yonder dome,
- Where grandeur with propriety combin'd,
- And Theodorus[^f72n1] with devotion dwelt;
- Involv'd in smouldering flames.—From every rock, [350]
- Dashes the turbid torrent; thro' each street
- A river foams, which sweeps, with untam'd might,
- Men, oxen, Cane-lands to the billowy main.—

[^f72n1]: Theodorus may be the Samian architect active c. 550–520 BCE.

[73]({{site.baseurl}}/images/p0087.jpg)

- Pauses the wind.—Anon the savage East
- Bids his wing'd tempests more relentless rave; [355]
- Now brighter, vaster corruscations[^f73n1] flash;
- Deepens the deluge; nearer thunders roll;
- Earth trembles; ocean reels; and, in her fangs,
- Grim Desolation tears the shrieking isle,
- Ere rosy Morn possess the ethereal plain, [360]
- To pour on darkness the full flood of day.— 

- NOR does the hurricane's all-wasting wrath
- Alone bring ruin on its founding wing:
- Even calms are dreadful, and the fiery South
- Oft reigns a tyrant in these fervid isles: [365]
- For, from its burning furnace, when it breathes,
- Europe and Asia's vegetable sons,
- Touch'd by its tainting vapour, shrivel'd, die.[^f73n2]
- The hardiest children of the rocks repine:
- And all the upland Tropic-plants hang down [370]
- Their drooping heads; shew arid, coil'd, adust.——
- The main itself seems parted into streams,
- Clear as a mirror; and, with deadly scents,
- Annoys the rower; who, heart-fainting, eyes
- The sails hang idly, noiseless, from the mast.[^f73n3] [375]


[^f73n1]: Vibratory or quivering flashes of light; lightning.

[^f73n2]: Grainger refers to the unsuitability of some Old World plants to the tropical Caribbean climate. Europeans nevertheless transplanted as many familiar Old World plants as they could to the Caribbean and, in doing so, transformed its ecology. They transplanted animals and diseases as well. This transplantation process is now known as the Columbian Exchange and included the movement of plants, animals, and diseases in both directions across the Atlantic.  

[^f73n3]: Refers to the doldrums, also called intertropical convergence zones, where prevailing (or trade) winds disappear and ships become immobile for days on end.

- Thrice hapless he, whom thus the hand of fate
- Compels to risque the insufferable beam!
- A fiend, the worst the angry skies ordain
- To punish sinful man, shall fatal seize
- His wretched life, and to the tomb consign. [380]

- WHEN such the ravage of the burning calm,
- On the stout, sunny children of the hill;
- What must thy Cane-lands feel? Thy late green sprouts
- Nor bunch, nor joint; but, sapless, arid, pine:
- Those, who have manhood reach'd, of yellow hue, [385]
- (Symptom of health and strength) soon ruddy show;
- While the rich juice that circled in their veins,
- Acescent,[^f74n1] watery, poor, unwholesome tastes.

- NOR only, planter, are thy Cane-groves burnt;
- Thy life is threatened. Muse, the manner sing. [390]

- THEN earthquakes, nature's agonizing pangs,
- Oft shake the astonied[^f74n2] isles: The solfaterre


> VER. 392. *solfaterre*\] Volcanos are called *sulphurs*, *or solfaterres*, in the West-Indies. There are few mountainous islands in that part of the globe without them, and those probably will destroy them in time. I saw much sulphur and alum[^f74n3] in the solfaterre at Mountserrat. The stream that runs through it, is almost as hot as boiling water, and its steams soon blacken silver, *&c*.


[^f74n1]: Sour, acidic.

[^f74n2]: This is a typographical error that would be corrected to "astonish'd" in the 1766 London edition of the poem.

[^f74n3]: An astringent mineral salt.
