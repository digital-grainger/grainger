## Fire

At the beginning of Book 3, James Grainger turns to the subject of crop time, the harvesting and processing of sugar cane. He portrays the enslaved laborers as happy to begin this work. But at line 55, an interesting thing happens: Grainger pivots to the subject of fire and imagines the cane field being set on fire, perhaps accidentally but also perhaps intentionally. Grainger does not specify whether the fire is caused by “the heavenly bolt” or by the “hand of malice;” nor does he specify who the arsonists might be. However, the fire at midnight might be the result of enslaved resistance on Caribbean plantations, since Grainger hints in Book 2 line 123 that enslaved Africans would sometimes set fire to cane fields to avoid working in fields that have been infested with cowitch (see Grainger's footnote of Book 2, line 123 on cowitch: "This extraordinary vine should not be permitted to grow in a Cane-piece; for Negroes have been known to fire the Canes, to save themselves from the torture which attends working in grounds where it has abounded."). 

This excerpt about the fire at midnight not only shows that the plantations are often vulnerable to catastrophes of fire and natural disasters, but also insinuates the tension between Caribbean plantations and enslaved laborers. Fire, the means of production can cause anxiety. Fire is one of the essential element in the process of transformeing cane-juice into sugar, especially in the furnaces of the boiling houses, but fire can also cause disasters on the plantation and threaten to destroy both the products and laborers. Fire is the only powerful weapon available for resistance. Although the poem does not explicitly depict violence toward the enslaved people, readers can still feel the destabilizing effects hidden under the "happy" harvest seasons. The rebellion of the enslaved people can be like the fire, spreading quickly and widely. The enslaved laborers, like fire, have both productive and destructive sides. 

As you read the below excerpts, think about the image of fire and its relationship with plantation and slavery. Why does Grainger bring up fire? How does he describe it and its origins? What kind of emotion can we get from Grainger's description. What roles do the enslaved laborers play in the process of sugar production? What does the turn to fire suggest about crop time and labor? What is the relationship between nature and human beings?

Note: Kathleen Donegan's chapter "Barbados: Wild Extravagance" from her book *Seasons of Misery: Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America* discusses the colonial catastrophe of fire in Barbados. Bonham C. Richardson in his book *Igniting the Caribbean's Past: Fire in British West Indian History* also points out that "All of the slave uprisings in the eastern Caribbean that preceded emancipation
in the 1830s involved the use or planned use of fire" (31).

- The ripened cane-piece; and, with her, to taste
- \(Delicious draught!\) the nectar of the mill! [45]

- THE planter's labour in a round revolves;[^f90n1]
- Ends with the year, and with the year begins.

- YE swains, to Heaven bend low in grateful prayer,
- Worship the Almighty; whose kind-fostering hand
- Hath blest your labour, and hath given the cane [50]
- To rise superior to each menac'd ill.

- NOR less, ye planters, in devotion, sue,
- That nor the heavenly bolt, nor casual spark,
- Nor hand of malice may the crop destroy.[^f90n2]

- AH me! what numerous, deafning bells, resound? [55]
- What cries of horror startle the dull sleep?
- What gleaming brightness makes, at midnight, day?
- By its portentuous glare, too well I see
- Palaemon's fate;[^f90n3] the virtuous, and the wise!
- Where were ye, watches, when the flame burst forth? [60]
- A little care had then the hydra[^f90n4] quell'd:
- But, now, what clouds of white smoke load the sky!
- How strong, how rapid the combustion pours!

[^f90n1]: Cane cultivation is a year-round affair that nevertheless has distinct rhythms, which arise from the fact that cane can take 15-24 months to mature.  

[^f90n2]: A reference to arson. Grainger does not specify who the arsonists might be, but this is one of several places where he hints at moments of enslaved resistance on Caribbean plantations. For more on this section of the poem and related passages, see "Fire" on this site. 

[^f90n3]: Palaemon, also known as Melicertes, was a Greco-Roman sea-god. According to one legend, the goddess Juno killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron; in another, Juno drove Ino, Melicertes' mother, and Melicertes mad, causing them to throw themselves into the Saronic Gulf, whereupon they were changed into marine deities. Ino became Leucothea, and Melicertes was renamed Palaemon.  

[^f90n4]: A mythic water snake whose multiple heads could regenerate if severed. Hercules killed the hydra as the second of his twelve Labors. The term also signifies a difficult task.

- Aid not, ye winds! with your destroying breath,
- The spreading vengeance.—They contemn my prayer. [65]

- ROUS'D by the deafning bells, the cries, the blaze;
- From every quarter, in tumultuous bands,
- The Negroes rush; and, 'mid the crackling flames,
- Plunge, daemon-like! All, all, urge every nerve:
- This way, tear up those Canes; dash the fire out, [70]
- Which sweeps, with serpent-error, o'er the ground.
- There, hew these down; their topmost branches burn:
- And here bid all thy watery engines play;
- For here the wind the burning deluge drives.

- IN vain.—More wide the blazing torrent rolls;[75]
- More loud it roars, more bright it fires the pole!
- And toward thy mansion, see, it bends its way.
- Haste! far, O far, your infant-throng remove:
- Quick from your stables drag your steeds and mules:
- With well-wet blankets guard your cypress-roofs; [80]
- And where thy dried Canes in large stacks are pil'd.—

- EFFORTS but serve to irritate the flames:
- Naught but thy ruin can their wrath appease.
- Ah, my Palaemon! what avail'd thy care,

> VER. 81. *And where thy dried Canes*\] The Cane-stalks which have been ground, are called *Magoss*; probably a corruption of the French word *Bagasse*,[^f91n1] which signifies the same thing. They make an excellent fewel.

[^f91n1]: Bagasse refers to the crushed sugar cane stalks that are the byproduct of milling cane. Rich in cellulose, bagasse can be used as fuel to boil cane syrup and as cattle feed.

- Oft to prevent the earliest dawn of day, [85]
- And walk thy ranges, at the noon of night?
- What tho' no ills assail'd thy bunching sprouts,
- And seasons pour'd obedient to thy will:
- All, all must perish; nor shalt thou preserve
- Wherewith to feed thy little orphan-throng. [90]

- OH, may the Cane-isles know few nights, like this!
