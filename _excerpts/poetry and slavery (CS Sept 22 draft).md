# Poetry and Slavery 

First published in London in 1764, James Grainger’s *The Sugar-Cane* circulated widely in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Two more editions of the poem were printed in London and Dublin in 1766, and magazines and anthologies also reprinted excerpts of it. Audiences around the British Atlantic world considered Grainger’s poem essential reading because it described the workings of Caribbean sugar plantations, which, by the mid-eighteenth century, were the primary economic engines of the Empire. 

To be clear, our goal in providing readers with this digital edition of Grainger's poem, howerver, is not to encourage readings that celebrate the might of empire. As scholars have amply documented since the poem was reprinted in the late 1990s, the productivity of Caribbean plantations rested upon the exploitation of enslaved African and indigenous laborers, most of whom were forcibly transported to the Caribbean in order to cultivate sugar. But as scholars have also realized, *The Sugar-Cane* can also serve as a valuable source of information about the experiences of the enslaved. Grainger provides numerousexamples of these experiences in the poem, sometimes deliberately and other times not. Specifically, the often lengthy footnotes that supplement his verse contain extensive descriptions of cultural practices, geographic networks, and of Caribbean flora, which was particularly interesting to a physician like Grainger, for who knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants was crucial. Where Grainger famously uses his footnotes to describe these medicinal properties, he often includes detailed information about the uses that Afro-Caribbean and indigenous peoples mad of plants in their day-today-lives. As such, we hope that readers of this edition will identify the literary and cultural context into which Grainger was writing, and understand some of the strategies of subsistence, survival, and resistance employed by the enslaved and other marginalized subjects within plantation colonies. 

Nevertheless, even with this goal in mind, *The Sugar-Cane* poses certain political, ethical, and aesthetic challenges for contemporary readers. First, Grainger intended the poem to ben an endorsement of the Caribbean plantation system. As its the sentiments make clear, Grainger was emphatically interested both in Britain's prosperity and in the continuation of slavery, which he believed could be reformed in order to simultaneously better the lives of the enslaved, and increase the profits of planters. Second, Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane* as a georgic, a poetic genre that was familiar to his contemporary audience, but is alien to most twenty-first-century readers. Third, the footnotes are often difficult to decipher, filling up pages on end and assuming specialized knowledge of scientific terms and names.  

We provide this brief introduction as a guide containing essential background information on Grainger and the georgic so that readers can better understand and engage with the poem. At the same time, we raise questions about Grainger's decision to depict slavery via the medium of poetry, and question his defense of the plantation system at a moment in history when some of his contemporaries were beginning to embrace the idea of abolition. Finally, we discuss the editorial strategies we employed when producing this edition, and try and make dissenting readings of the poem--especially ones that focus on what could be called the "counter-plantation," versus the plantation--available to users of this site. 


## Who Was Grainger?

James Grainger was destined for neither literary nor scientific greatness. Like so many other eighteenth-century British men, however, he was able to navigate the commercial and intellectual networks that were opened by Britain's expanding imperial and colonial endeavors. Grainger was born in the mid-1720s in Duns, a small town near Scotland's southern border with England. His father bankrupted himself with a series of failed investments, and young James was orphaned around the age of ten. He was placed under the guardianship of his half-brother William, apprenticed to an Edinburgh surgeon soon afterward, and enrolled in 1739 to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which was already on its way to becoming a center of the global Enlightenment. His career trajectory from there was fairly typical for a man of his background: he enlisted as a regimental surgeon in the mid-1740s and then served in Scotland during the Jacobite uprising (1745) and in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748). Upon his return to civilian life, he wrote a dissertation on the treatment of syphilis that was published in 1753, and he moved to London to practice medicine in the mid-1750s.

The move to London brought Grainger into the heart of Britain's literary world. He soon made friends with literati like Samuel Johnson, Bishop Thomas Percy, Oliver Goldsmith, William Shenstone, and Charlotte Lennox, all of whom would figure in *The Sugar-Cane* and some of whom also helped Grainger revise and publish it. Before *The Sugar-Cane* appeared and during his years in London, Grainger published several short poems, reviews, and a longer translation of Tibullus (ca. 55-19 BCE). Nevertheless, he struggled financially. Concluding that he would never make his fortune independently, he took on John Bourryau (ca. 1737-1760), his 21-year-old former pupil as a patron. Grainger and Bourryau's patronage agreement would pay the poet a £200 annuity upon his return to Britain from a four-year voyage, during which he would accompany Bourryau to the continent and to St. Kitts, where Bourryau had recently inherited a sugar estate.

The two men left for the Caribbean in the spring of 1759. During the crossing, Grainger was called upon to treat a woman who had been infected with smallpox just prior to embarking. As he nursed the woman back to health, he made the acquaintance of her daughter, Daniel Matthew Burt, whom he married soon after their arrival in St. Kitts. Having decided to remain in the Caribbean in order to establish himself as a physician, Grainger and Bourryau annulled their patronage agreement. Moreover, because Burt came from a family of wealthy planters, Grainger soon became a plantation physician, a potentially lucrative position that he hoped would eventually allow him to establish a plantation of his own--if not in St. Kitts, then in St. Vincent. He also decided to write a long poem about the Caribbean soon after his arrival on the island, and he completed an early draft of *The Sugar-Cane* in 1762, when he sent the manuscript off to his friend Thomas Percy for comments. The first edition of the poem was published in 1764, the same year that his prose *Essay on the More Common West India Diseases* appeared in print. In 1765, Percy also included Grainger's "Bryan and Pereene, a West-Indian Ballad" in *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry*.

Grainger complained bitterly about the isolation he felt in St. Kitts and about what he saw as his fellow colonists' lack of culture. Nevertheless, he only returned to England briefly in 1763, perhaps in part to help supervise the publication of *The Sugar-Cane*.  He died in St. Kitts in December 1766, leaving behind his wife and a young daughter named Louise. At the end of the eighteenth century, Percy collaborated with Robert Anderson to produce a collection of his works, which appeared in 1802.


## Why a Georgic?

Taking its name from the Greek word for agriculture (*&#947;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#940;*), the georgic is one of the major classical poetic genres alongside the epic (which treats heroic events) and the pastoral (which treats the rural lives of shepherds). In the eyes of eighteenth-century British readers, the most famous and most praised georgic was in fact Virgil's *Georgics* (ca. 29 BCE). Split into four books, the traditional georgic poem aims both to instruct readers in the art of agriculture (including planting and animal husbandry) and to praise the effects of agricultural labor on farmers and society. John Dryden led a resurgence of interest in the georgic when he translated Virgil's poem from the Latin in 1697. Following Dryden, a number of writers composed traditional georgics that highlighted the virtues of British agriculture. These poems included John Philips' *The Cyder* (1708), William Somerville's *The Chace* (1735), Christopher Smart's *The Hop-Garden* (1752), and John Dyer's *The Fleece* (1757), all of which feature in Grainger's poem. In praising British agricultural goods, these georgics performed important cultural work, emphasizing Britain's natural resources as well as the commercial power the nation wielded in trading these goods across the globe. 

Although *The Sugar-Cane* was published relatively late in the British georgic revival, Grainger's decision to write the poem as a georgic makes a decisive statement about his ambitions: he wanted to establish himself as a great writer able to follow in the footsteps of classical figures like Virgil, and he wanted to underscore the importance of the Caribbean colonies to the British Empire, the overall strength of which he also sought to celebrate. At the same time, Grainger had to address one obvious difference between *The Sugar-Cane* and its predecessors: St. Kitts, the setting of *The Sugar-Cane*, was not in Britain. Moreover, sugarcane was not a British plant. Indeed, most of the tropical plants found in the Caribbean were unfamiliar to British readers, as was the process of sugar production. What does it mean, then, to praise British agricultural labor and commerce under these conditions? Grainger addresses these issues directly in his preface and tries to turn them to his advantage. First, he explains that the Caribbean landscape is so novel and beautiful that it cannot help but "enrich poetry with many new and picturesque images" (v). Second, he claims that he will use the poem to introduce British readers to new words and concepts, particularly by providing extensive notes that would act as a natural history or account of Caribbean nature. Aware that the addition of notes and scientific information could open him up to criticism from poetic traditionalists, Grainger coined the term "West-India georgic" to describe his hybrid work, asking that his readers consider him "a physician, and not a poet" (vii) when he veered too much into botany and medicine.


## How Does Grainger Depict Slavery in *The Sugar-Cane*?

In writing *The Sugar-Cane*, Grainger faced a difficult challenge. On the one hand, the georgic traditionally emphasized the healthful benefits of labor and sought to demonstrate that a nation's power and liberty were rooted in its commerce. On the other hand, the eighteenth-century production of sugar--and the strength and prosperity of the British Empire--were built on the labor of enslaved persons. As such, Grainger adopted various (and sometimes contradictory) strategies for managing the task of depicting enslavement as a beneficial and even desirable state of being for African people.

For example, Grainger chose to use classical georgic vocabulary to describe enslaved laborers. Georgic poets before him had referred to shepherds and agricultural workers as "swains" and "hinds," and he used the terms liberally to cover the violence that was inherent to plantation slavery. Knolwedgeable readers will point out that Virgil's farmers also relied on enslaved labor, but the distinction between first century BCE Roman slavery and the increasingly racial slavery of eighteenth-century Caribbean planations bears careful scrutiny. Second, Grainger used his poem to advocate for what came to be known as amelioration. Ameliorationists like Grainger believed that, if enslavers treated the enslaved "humanely," then the practice could be both profitable to enslavers and pleasant for the enslaved. This belief is clearly  abhorrent, and it was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to perpetuate plantation slavery and to counter the rising popularity of the abolitionist movement. 

It is not necessarily surprising that Grainger would have taken on an ameliorationist position: he married into a family of enslavers and hoped to profit from the system of plantation slavery himself. Nevertheless, there are moments in the poem when the cruelties of life on the plantation become too great for Grainger to ignore or cover over with aestheticized language. Indeed, one could even argue that, in these moments, Grainger's attempts at aestheticization inadvertently highlight the paradoxes in his position and the impossibility of portraying slavery in a positive light. For example, in one passage of the poem that describes the milling of cane, a process during which enslaverd laborers hand-fed cane stalks into large steel rollers that would then crush the plant and extract the sugar-filled juice inside. Grainger writes,

> AND now thy mills dance eager in the gale;  
> Feed well their eagerness: but O beware;  
> Nor trust, between the steel-cas’d cylinders,  
> The hand incautious: off the member snapt  
> Thou’lt ever rue; sad spectacle of woe! (III.165-169)  
{:.indented}

Although Grainger personifies the mills, emphasizing their "eagerness" to process the cane themselves, thereby avoiding discussion of the human beings who were forced to do the actual labor of feeding the mills, his commitment to providing a full account of sugar production compels him to acknowledge both how dangerous millwork is, and the serious harm it could do to the people who performed it under the coercive threat of punishment. Admitting this harm, Grainger immediately turns to sentimental language ("sad spectacle[s] of woe,") in order to avoid dwelling further on the physical toll of enslavement. Grainger elaborates this language further in his footnote to line 168, where he blames such accidents on the "unfortunate wretch" and his "imprudence or sleepiness." [^fn1]

There are other moments that similarly draw attention to themselves for their incongruity, and some of these were even criticized by Grainger's contemporaries as glossing over the harsh realities of slavery in a too insensitive or unfeeling manner. For example, in a review of *The Sugar-Cane* for the *Critical Review*, Grainger's friend Johnson largely praised the poem but complained about the following passage, where Grainger turns to the subject of examining African captives newly arrived in the Caribbean and determining their healthfulness and suitability for plantation labor:

> Clear roll their ample eye; their tongue be red;  
> Broad swell their chest; their shoulders wide expand;  
> Not prominent their belly; clean and strong  
> Their thighs and legs, in just proportion rise. (IV.74-77)  
{:.indented}

It was in fact common practice for enslavers to perform the kind of physical inspection Grainger describes, and scenes such as these would become set pieces in abolitionist writings later in the century. Indeed, these lines disturbed Samuel Johnson who, despite his generally positive review of *The Sugar-Cane*, wrote in response: "[H]ere we think that tenderness and humanity, with which the former part of the poem seems replete, is, in some measure, forgotten. The poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation; but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for chusing an horse” (277). Johnson does not condemn Grainger completely and even seems to endorse his ameliorationist agenda by praising his "tenderness and humanity" in earlier parts of the poem, but he also calls the slave trade an "ungenerous commerce" and objects to Grainger's implicit equation of the enslaved with animals or mere objects. In these lines, 

Although Grainger's ameliorationist and other pro-slavery positions were shared by many of his contemporaries, abolitionist ideas became increasingly prevalent and popular in the years immediately following the publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. In the 1772 *Somerset v. Stewart* case (also known as the Somerset ruling), presiding judge William Murray, first earl of Mansfield declared that British common law did not explicitly endorse slavery, and that the practice was therefor not legal in Britain. In practice, this meant that when an enslaved person was brought to Britain from the American colonies, that person could not be forcibly detained or sent back across the Atlantic in a state of servitude. Mansfield's decision did not formally abolish slavery in Britain, but many understood it to have done so in practice. Then, in 1773, the publication of Phillis Wheatley's *Poems on Various Subjects* catalyzed public debate over the equality, treatment, and status of the enslaved. And in 1775, Philadelphia-based Quaker Anthony Benezet founded the *Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage*, one of the first abolitionist organizations in the Atlantic world.

Grainger himself veers into abolitionism for one brief interlude in *The Sugar-Cane*. This interlude comes in Book IV, when the narrator wishes that poetry could grant freedom to all. He laments:

> OH, did the tender muse possess the power,
> Which monarchs have, and monarchs oft abuse:
> ‘Twould be the fond ambition of her soul,
> To quell tyrannic sway; knock off the chains [235]
> Of heart-debasing slavery; give to man,
> Of every colour and of every clime,
> Freedom, which stamps him image of his God. (232-238)

It is worth asking why Grainger would include these lines in a work defending slavery? To what extent did the conflict between the sentiments of the classical georgic and the realities of eighteenth-century slavery create tension and paradox in his poetry? Are there other signs of ambivalence, doubt, or dissent in *The Sugar-Cane*? Can we read for those signs, and can we even possibly use the poem as a source for information and knowledge about the plantation that would undermine Grainger's intention of validating it? 


## Why a Digital Edition? 

We hope that the questions above will prompt further consideration by readers of this edition. We also want readers to formulate their own questions and ways of reading *The Sugar-Cane*. To that end, we have decided to create this digital edition of Grainger's poem, knowing that this format will allow for reading strategies that are more difficult to undertake on paper.

There are already two modern versions of *The Sugar-Cane* available in print. One is John Gilmore' 1999 *Poetics of Empire*, a scholarly edition of *The Sugar-Cane* that contains a wealth of information about the poem and Grainger's sources. In fact, we have relied on Gilmore's footnotes to supplement the gaps in our own, and want to acknowledge that debt here. We also acknowledge it in individual footnotes that cite Gilmore where appropriate. There is also a version of the poem in Thomas W. Krise's 1999 *Caribbeana*, an excellent anthology of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writing about the Caribbean. Krise's anthology is similar to our edition in spirit, as both are designed for potential use in the classroom. 

Our edition differs from Krise and Gilmore's works, however, in that we take advantage of the flexibility of a digital platform to provide readers with multiple versions of the poem. These versions include:

> A "full text" version  
> A "page by page" version  
> Excerpts from the poem focused on specific themes and grouped under the rubric of the "counter-plantation"  
{:.indented}

What we are calling the "full text" version contains the entire poem on a single page. In other words, readers can enjoy a continuous reading experience by scrolling through the edition without ever having to click backward or forward on their browser. This version of the poem also makes it easier to perform global keyword searches. To see all the uses of a particular word in the poem, for example, readers can either use their browser's "Find" command, or use the "Search" function included on our site's sidebar. This version of the poem also makes it easier for readers to print or save a copy of the poem for consultation offline. We recommend first using the browser's "Print" command to create a PDF of the full text, and then either saving or printing the file.

The second version of the poem allows the reader to click through *The Sugar-Cane* poem page by page. Our transcriptions and page breaks strictly adhere to Grainger's work, providing the reader with an experience analagous to reading the 1764, London edition, which we used as the basis for our own. Each page also includes a link to the corresponding page image from a copy of the print edition that we obtained for this project. Any reader who wishes to compare our transcription with the original ought to use this page-by-page version of the poem. 

The excerpts grouped under "The Counter-Plantation" on the home page, constitute a final version (or versions) of *The Sugar-Cane*. Each excerpt groups a set of passages that focus on specific themes like indigenous presence and obeah. These excerpts also include short essays or headnotes prefacing each group of passages, providing key background information, and guiding questions for readers.  

In deciding what topics to focus on for the counter-plantation excerpts, we chose ones that would highlight Grainger's brief, yet undeniably present discussions of ongoing persistence and resistance under the system of plantation slavery. In other words, the goal of these excerpts is to enable counter-plantation readings of the poem that work against the grain of Grainger's pro-slavery narrative. First used by Yvonne Acosta and Jean Casimir, the term counter-plantation describes those elements of the Caribbean plantation system that helped the formerly enslaved become independent cultivators after emancipation. These elements included provision grounds, which the enslaved used to grow food crops for their own survival (see our excerpt on "Provision Grounds" for more information). In the spirit of Saidiya Hartman's call for scholars to create "counter-histories of slavery," however, we also include excerpts on themes that we believe will push readers to challenge Grainger's narrative of imperial prosperity and formulate "counter-readings" of their own (4).[^fn2] Our hope is that these excerpts might inspire a willingness not only to read the poem creatively but also to re-arrange it and bring the everyday lives of the enslaved and other marginalized subjects of the plantation to the foreground of analysis. 

Indeed, the image we have included at the top of our homepage is an original work of art by Vanessa Lee, who was kind enough to participate in our project of encouraging readers to "break" *The Sugar-Cane*. The piece of cane in Lee's image is a reproduction of the frontispiece illustration for the 1764 edition of the poem, although the stalk is whole in the print edition.[^fn3] Lee's illustration also includes the image of a rat to reference one of the most well-known, if likely apocryphal stories about critical reaction to *The Sugar-Cane*. In his *Life of Johnson*, James Boswell recalls a reading of a manuscript draft of the poem that took place at the London home of eighteenth-century painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. When the line, “Now, Muse, let’s sing of rats” was read aloud, the audience is said to have burst into laughter. An embarrassed Grainger deleted the word “rats” from the poem and replaced it with “whisker’d vermine-race” (II.62). And yet, both the persistence of this story about rats in Grainger scholarship and the invasive presence of rats on eighteenth-century sugar plantations are reminders that the material realities of the sugar trade always threatened plantation profits and likewise threatened the reception of the poem. As much as Grainger tried to contain the harsh realities of sugar cultivation and enslavement, these ultimately could not be papered over with poetic language.[^fn4] We therefore ask readers to keep these realities in mind when reading the poem. While *The Sugar-Cane* ought to be read carefully and with close attention to detail, Grainger should not be treated as an author or authority who must be revered. 


## Notes on Transcription and Language

In creating this edition, we have striven to produce a "semidiplomatic" edition that faithfully reproduces all of the important features of the 1764 edition (Driscoll 254). As such, we made no changes or corrections to Grainger's words or spelling. We also largely reproduced the punctuation from the 1764 edition. Nevertheless, because we want to provide a readable edition of the work that will be accessible to eighteenth-century specialists and non-specialists alike, we have made the following changes to the text in our transcription:

> We modernized any uses of the 'long s'
> We substituted standard capital letters for any large, small, or otherwise irregular capital letters
> We did not replicate ligatures between letters 
> We eliminated any extra spaces in front of punctuation marks 
> We did not maintain Grainger's practice of indenting each new stanza of poetry and each of his footnotes
> We indented and centered text only when not doing so would impair readability (i.e., text on title pages is uncentered)
> We did not replicate the headers on each page that repeated the book number and title of the work
> We did not replicate printer's marks in the footers of pages
> We did not maintain the eighteenth-century practice of repeating the first word of a page on at the bottom of the previous page. This practice was followed in the eighteenth century because it was thought to improve readability, but it is no longer conventional to follow it today. 
{:.indented}

Finally, Grainger and other eighteenth-century writers were often inconsistent in their use of terms to describe peoples and places. They also used terms for Caribbean colonization and slavery that many scholars no longer consider to be accurate, representative, or appropriate. As a result, we have made an effort to use the following terms, versus Grainger's, in our own commentary and footnotes on *The Sugar-Cane*: 

> "African" for people born in Africa  
> "Afro-Caribbean" for those established in the Caribbean  
> "British" (or Scottish or English or Welsh) for people born in Britain  
> "Caribbean" for "West Indies"  
> "Creole" for any non-indigenous person born in the Caribbean  
> "Enslaved person" rather than "slave"  
> "Fugitive person" rather than "runaway slave"  
> "Indigenous" for "native" peoples  
> "St. Kitts" for "St. Christopher"
