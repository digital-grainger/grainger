## Indigeneity  

Long before the arrival of European imperial agents, the Caribbean was home for milennia to Amerindians who learned to use its vast natural resources. Indeed, the Caribbean itself draws its name from the Carib peoples. The Kalinago Caribs inhabited the Leeward and Windward Islands, while the Kalina Caribs resided in northern South America. The Arawaks, so named because of their language, also inhabited the Greater and Lesser Antilles and coastal South America, and as a result, the Caribs and Arawaks often clashed over territorial rights. Each of these groups relied upon and utilized the region's natural resources: cultivating crops for food and drink and learning which plants' shoots and juices could be used as medicine or wielded as poison. 

Faced with the task of describing various plants and reporting their possible uses, Grainger credits Kalinago persons, whom he most often calls "Indians," with this knowledge in several passages primarily in Book I but also in Books III and IV of the poem. These references, although limited in number, demonstrate the depth of indigneous botanical and bodily knowledge, ranging from medicine to food and resistance to cataloguing. In some cases, such as his description of the part of the cane called the "arrow," named for its usage by indigenous persons, these applications are so crucial to recognizing and describing these plants (in this case, the part of the sugar cane that drops at a specific point in the maturation process) that they actually dictate the names that colonial planters and writers use to reference them. Yet at the same time, Grainger relegates almost all mentions of indigenous peoples and knowledge in *The Sugar-Cane* to footnotes. Additionally, he appropriates this knowledge in his preface to the poem, claiming that he has learned about "indigneous remedies" so thoroughlly as to make his own "trials" of them. Moreover, by arguing that such knowledge and abilities should be "universally known," Grainger further distributes this knowledge outside of indigenous communities, positioning his own text as the new source of such information.  

Despite such attempts to limit the bounds and influence of indigenous knowledge, by collating such mentions here, we hope to allow the reader to recognize, explore, and meditate upon indigenous, rather than colonial, authority. How does Grainger characterize the relationship between indigenous and colonial persons, and what exactly does he credit Amerindians with teaching him and other colonists? How does referring to indigenous peoples as "Indians" rather than "Caribs" or "Kalinago" impact his readers' perception of such nations? What effect does Grainger's inclusion of indigenous words like "Liamuiga" and "suirsaak" have? What do you make of his frequent use of the passive voice in his description of these plants' uses?

IN a West-India georgic,[^fviin2] the mention of many indigenous remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is, I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known.[^fviin3] And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet.[^fviin4]

[^fviin2]: A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that the Caribbean would transform the face of poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and imagines a new form for it (West-India). It is worth considering what specifically about this poem makes it West Indian or Caribbean.

[^fviin3]: Grainger's mention of indigenous remedies refers in part to the knowledge possessed by indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, but it also refers to the local knowledge that African and European transplants to the Caribbean developed as they learned about the new environment. In particular, Grainger uses the poem to display his knowledge of husbandry, medicine, and natural history. We have tried in our notes to identify the origins of the natural entities, and especially plants, named by Grainger. While some of these plants do originate from the Caribbean and the Americas, others come from Africa, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. In many cases, these foreign plants were brought to the Caribbean purposefully, as individuals sought to transform their new homes by importing crops and commodities that could help them survive and profit.  

[^fviin4]: Born in Scotland, Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions dating back at least to the mid-1750s, when he settled in London. The sentence that closes his preface has long fascinated critics because it suggests a certain ambivalence about the aims and the form of the poem. Certainly, Grainger was aware that the inclusion of local knowledge and the proliferation of footnotes were unusual, and he anticipated criticism of his choices.

VER. 170. *Yet will the arrow,*] That part of the Cane which shoots up into the fructification, is called by planters its Arrow, having been probably used for that purpose by the Indians. Till the arrow drops, all additional jointing in the Cane is supposed to be stopped.

VER. 596. *cassada,*\] Cassavi, cassava, is called *Jatropha* by botanists. Its meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous. There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*.[^f41n3] The colour of its root is white, like a parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the Indians prepare many wholesome dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and, being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob. Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The French name it *Manihot*, *Magnoc*, and *Manioc*, and the Spaniards *Mandiocha*. It is pretended that all creatures but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink[^f41n4] is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There is one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*.[^f41n5]

[^f41n3]: Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour (Higman 62).   

[^f41n4]: There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino (Higman 69).

[^f41n5]: Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America (now the name of the capital of French Guiana).

VER. 598. *to the soursop*\] The true Indian name of this tree is *Suirsaak*. It grows in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds. Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an acid. It is one of the *Anonas*, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples.[^f42n5] The leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the West-Indies. The botanical name is *Guanabanus*. The French call it *Petit Corosol*, or *Coeur de Boeuf*, to which the fruit bears a resemblance. The root, being reduced to a powder, and snuffed up the nose, produces the same effect as tobacco. Taken by the mouth, the Indians pretend it is a specific in the epilepsy.

VER. 605. *cacao-walk*\] It is also called *Cocao* and *Cocô*. It is a native of some of

[^f42n5]: Custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree whose native range is Mexico to northeastern Venezuela. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (Higman 202). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.

the provinces of South America, and a drink made from it was the common food of the Indians before the Spaniards came among them, who were some time in those countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed, that the Indian chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I much doubt whether the Europeans have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and other hot ingredients.[^f43n2] The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is streight and handsome. The pods, which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of the size of a slatted olive,[^f43n3] grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree loves a moist, rich and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes screen them by a hardier tree, which the Spaniards aptly term *Madre de Cacao*.[^f43n4] They may be planted fifteen or twenty feet distant, though some advise to plant them much nearer, and perhaps wisely; for it is an easy matter to thin them, when they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, *&c*. Some recommend planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young, to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally three years before they produce good pods;[^f43n5] but, in six years, they are in highest perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.[^f43n6] There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour and goodness of their nuts.[^f43n7] That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. None of the species grow in Peru. Its alimentary, as well as physical properties, are sufficiently known. This word is Indian.[^f43n8]

[^f43n2]: The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Mexico and Belize, as well as other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which have a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry.  

[^f43n3]: The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years.    

[^f43n4]: *Gliricidia sepium*. Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[^f43n5]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[^f43n6]: The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) has a native range extending from Himalaya to northern Thailand.  

[^f43n7]: There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

[^f43n8]: "Cacao" is derived from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."

VER. 350. *For taste, for colour, and for various use:*\] It were impossible, in the short limits of a note, to enumerate the various uses of Sugar; and, indeed, as these are in general so well known, it is needless. A few properties of it, however, wherewith the learned are not commonly acquainted, I shall mention. In some places of the East-Indies, an excellent arrack[^f106n2] is made from the Sugar-Cane: And, in South-America, Sugar is used as an antidote against one of the most sudden, as well as fatal poisons in the world. Taken by mouth, *pocula morte carent*, this poison is quite innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood of the body immediately to the heart, it forthwith bursts it.[^f106n3] The fish and birds killed by these poisoned arrows \(in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert\) are perfectly wholesome to feed on. See Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon.[^f106n4] It is a vegetable preparation.

[^f106n2]: An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).

[^f106n3]: The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.

[^f106n4]: Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).

VER. 567. *Indian millet*\] Or maise. This is commonly called *Guinea-corn*, to distinguish it from the great or Indian-corn, that grows in the southern parts of North-America.[^f156n4] It soon shoots up to a great height, often twenty feet high, and will ratoon like the other; but its blades are not so nourishing to horses as those of the great corn, although its seeds are more so, and rather more agreeable to the taste. The Indians, Negroes, and poor white people, make many (not unsavoury) dishes with them. It is also called *Turkey wheat*. The turpentine tree[^f156n5] will also grow in the sand, and is most useful upon a plantation. 

[^f156n4]: Maize, great corn, and Indian corn are all different names for *Zea mays*.

[^f156n5]: Likely *Bursera simaruba*, a tree whose native range is the Caribbean and Mexico to Brazil.
