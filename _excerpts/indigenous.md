## Indigeneity 

Long before the arrival of European colonists, the Caribbean was home for millennia to Amerindians. Indeed, the Caribbean draws its name from the Carib peoples. The Kalinago Caribs inhabited the Leeward and Windward Islands, while the Kalina Caribs resided in northern South America. The Arawaks, so named because of their language, also inhabited the Greater and Lesser Antilles and coastal South America, and, as a result, the Caribs and Arawaks often clashed over territorial rights. In spite of their conflicts, all of these groups relied upon and utilized the region's natural resources: they cultivated crops for food and drink, and they learned which plants could be used as medicine or wielded as poison. 

Faced with the task of describing various plants and reporting their possible uses, Grainger credits Kalinago persons, whom he most often calls "Indians," with this knowledge in several passages. These passages appear primarily in Book I, but there are also mentions in Books III and IV. These references, although limited in number, demonstrate the depth of indigenous botanical and ecological knowledge. At the same time, Grainger relegates most mentions of indigenous peoples and knowledge in *The Sugar-Cane* to footnotes. Additionally, he appropriates this knowledge in his preface to the poem, claiming that he has learned about "indigneous remedies" so thoroughlly as to make his own "trials" of them. Moreover, by arguing that such knowledge and abilities should be "universally known," Grainger further distributes this knowledge outside of indigenous communities, positioning his own text as the source of such information.  

Despite Grainger's attempts to take possession of indigenous knowledge, we hope to allow the reader to recognize, explore, and meditate upon indigenous, rather than colonial, authority by collating Grainger's mentions of indigenous peoples and the information he gained from them. Questions to consider include, How does Grainger characterize the relationship between indigenous and colonial persons, and what exactly does he credit Amerindians with teaching him and other colonists? How does referring to indigenous peoples as "Indians" rather than "Caribs," "Kalinago," or "Arawak" impact his readers' perception of such nations? Why does Grainger include indigenous words like "Liamuiga" and "suirsaak"? What effect does his frequent use of the passive voice have on our recognition of the origins and applications of plant knowledge? Why does Grainger turn to "Indian gardens" in Book IV, just before the close of the poem?

IN a West-India georgic,[^fviin2] the mention of many indigenous remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is, I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known.[^fviin3] And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not as a poet....[^fviin4]

[^fviin2]: A term of Grainger's invention. Building on his opening claim that the Caribbean would transform the face of poetry, Grainger simultaneously leans on a traditional mode (the georgic) and imagines a new form for it (West-India). It is worth considering what specifically about this poem makes it West Indian or Caribbean.

[^fviin3]: Grainger's mention of indigenous remedies refers in part to the knowledge possessed by indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, but it also refers to the local knowledge that African and European transplants to the Caribbean developed as they learned about the new environment. In particular, Grainger uses the poem to display his knowledge of husbandry, medicine, and natural history. We have tried in our notes to identify the origins of the natural entities, and especially plants, named by Grainger. While some of these plants do originate from the Caribbean and the Americas, others come from Africa, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. In many cases, these foreign plants were brought to the Caribbean purposefully, as individuals sought to transform their new homes by importing crops and commodities that could help them survive and profit.  

[^fviin4]: Born in Scotland, Grainger was trained as a physician in Edinburgh, but he had significant literary ambitions dating back at least to the mid-1750s, when he settled in London. The sentence that closes his preface has long fascinated critics because it suggests a certain ambivalence about the aims and the form of the poem. Certainly, Grainger was aware that the inclusion of local knowledge and the proliferation of footnotes were unusual, and he anticipated criticism of his choices.

VER. 596. *cassada,*\] Cassavi, cassava, is called *Jatropha* by botanists. Its meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous. There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the juice; this the French call *Camagnoc*.[^f41n3] The colour of its root is white, like a parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the Indians prepare many wholesome dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and, being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob. Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The French name it *Manihot*, *Magnoc*, and *Manioc*, and the Spaniards *Mandiocha*. It is pretended that all creatures but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink[^f41n4] is prepared from this root by the Indians, Spaniards, and Portuguese, according to Pineda. There is one species of this plant which the Indians only use, and is by them called *Baccacoua*....[^f41n5]

[^f41n3]: Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: sweet and bitter. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour (Higman 62).   

[^f41n4]: There are reports from the colonial Caribbean of cassava being made into a drink called perino (Higman 69).

[^f41n5]: Jean Antoine Bruletout de Préfontaine's *Maison rustique, à l'usage des habitans de la partie de la France équinoxiale connue sous le nom de Cayenne* (1763) also mentions a kind of cassava called Baccacoua that is consumed only by the Amerindians in Cayenne, a French colony on the northeastern coast of South America (now the name of the capital of French Guiana).

> VER. 598. *to the soursop*\] The true Indian name of this tree is *Suirsaak*. It grows in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds. Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an acid. It is one of the *Anonas*, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples.[^f42n4] The leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the West-Indies. The botanical name is *Guanabanus*. The French call it *Petit Corosol*, or *Coeur de Boeuf*, to which the fruit bears a resemblance. The root, being reduced to a powder, and snuffed up the nose, produces the same effect as tobacco. Taken by the mouth, the Indians pretend it is a specific in the epilepsy....

VER. 605. *cacao-walk*\] It is also called *Cocao* and *Cocô*. It is a native of some of


[^f42n4]: The custard apple (*Annona reticulata*) is the fruit of a tree whose native range is Mexico to northeastern Venezuela. The star apple (*Chrysophyllum cainito*) is the fruit of a tree native to the Greater Antilles (Higman 202). Sugar apple (*Annona squamosa*), also known as sweetsop, is the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.

the provinces of South America, and a drink made from it was the common food of the Indians before the Spaniards came among them, who were some time in those countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed, that the Indian chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I much doubt whether the Europeans have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and other hot ingredients.[^f43n2] The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is streight and handsome. The pods, which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of the size of a slatted olive,[^f43n3] grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree loves a moist, rich and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes screen them by a hardier tree, which the Spaniards aptly term *Madre de Cacao*.[^f43n4] They may be planted fifteen or twenty feet distant, though some advise to plant them much nearer, and perhaps wisely; for it is an easy matter to thin them, when they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, *&c*. Some recommend planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young, to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally three years before they produce good pods;[^f43n5] but, in six years, they are in highest perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.[^f43n6] There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour and goodness of their nuts.[^f43n7] That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. None of the species grow in Peru. Its alimentary, as well as physical properties, are sufficiently known. This word is Indian.[^f43n8]

[^f43n2]: The Aztecs flavored their chocolate with vanilla (*Vanilla planifolia*), which is native to Mexico and Belize, as well as other spices, including chili peppers (genus *Capsicum*), which have a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas. Grainger was not necessarily thinking of the spiciness of ingredients when he referred to them as "hot," however. He may instead have meant that vanilla, pepper, and other spices were hot in a humoral sense: according to humoral theories of health, all foods possessed elemental qualities that reflected some combination of heat, moisture, coldness, or dryness. These foods could, in turn, impart those qualities to those who ate them and thus needed to be regulated to complement the humoral properties of consumers' bodies, which also were hot, cold, moist, or dry.  

[^f43n3]: The olive tree (*Olea europaea*) is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years.    

[^f43n4]: *Gliricidia sepium*. Its native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

[^f43n5]: Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.  

[^f43n6]: The cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*) has a native range extending from Himalaya to northern Thailand.  

[^f43n7]: There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety and probably the one Grainger was referencing, since it is still grown in Venezuela (Caracas is the capital of Venezuela).   

[^f43n8]: "Cacao" is derived from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*. The scientific name for cacao, *Theobroma cacao*, also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."

VER. 350. *For taste, for colour, and for various use:*\] It were impossible, in the short limits of a note, to enumerate the various uses of Sugar; and, indeed, as these are in general so well known, it is needless. A few properties of it, however, wherewith the learned are not commonly acquainted, I shall mention. In some places of the East-Indies, an excellent arrack[^f106n2] is made from the Sugar-Cane: And, in South-America, Sugar is used as an antidote against one of the most sudden, as well as fatal poisons in the world. Taken by mouth, *pocula morte carent*, this poison is quite innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood of the body immediately to the heart, it forthwith bursts it.[^f106n3] The fish and birds killed by these poisoned arrows \(in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert\) are perfectly wholesome to feed on. See Ulloa and De la Condamine's account of the great river of Amazon.[^f106n4] It is a vegetable preparation....

[^f106n2]: An alcoholic spirit distilled from fermented rice and molasses, to which is often added the fermented sap of the coconut palm (*Cocos nucifera*).

[^f106n3]: The poison Grainger refers to is curare, an extract obtained from the bark of South American trees of the genera *Strychnos* and *Chondrodendron* that relaxes and paralyzes voluntary muscles. Curare's use as an arrow poison was reported by Europeans from their earliest encounters with Amerindians in South America.

[^f106n4]: Antonio de Ulloa (1716-1795), a Spanish military officer, and Charles-Marie de La Condamine (1701-1774), a French scientist, participated in a geodesic mission to the equator in Peru to measure the earth's true shape. After the mission was completed, La Condamine published the *Relation abrégée d'un voyage fait dans l'intérieur de l'Amérique méridionale* (1745) and *Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi a l’équateur* (1751). Ulloa co-authored with Jorge Juan the *Relación histórica del viage a la América meridional* (1748).

- Perhaps, of Indian gardens[^f151n1] I could sing,
- Beyond what bloom'd on blest Phaeacia's isle,[^f151n2]
- Or eastern climes admir'd in days of yore: [490]
- How Europe's foodful, culinary plants;
- How gay Pomona's[^f151n3] ruby-tinctured births;
- And gawdy Flora's[^f151n4] various-vested train;
- Might be instructed to unlearn their clime,
- And by due discipline adopt the sun. [495]
- The muse might tell what culture will entice
- The ripened melon, to perfume each month;
- And with the anana[^f151n5] load the fragrant board.
- The muse might tell, what trees will best exclude
- ("Insuperable height of airiest shade")[^f151n6] [500]
- With their vast umbrage[^f151n7] the noon's fervent ray.
- Thee, verdant mammey,[^f151n8] first, her song should praise:


> VER. 502. *mammey*\] This is a lofty, shady, and beautiful tree. Its fruit is as large as the largest melon, and of an exquisite smell, greatly superior to it in point of taste. Within the fruit are contained one or two large stones, which when distilled, give to spirits a ratafia flavour,[^f151n9] and therefore the French call them *Les apricots de St. Domingue*:[^f151n10] accordingly, the *l'eau des noiaux*, one of the best West-Indian cordials, is made from them.[^f151n11] The fruit, eaten raw, is of an aperient[^f151n12] quality; and made into sweet-meats,[^f151n13]


[^f151n1]: Early colonial reports from the Caribbean describe flourishing Amerindian gardens. Amerindians generally practiced conuco or mound cultivation, in which various plants were intercropped or cultivated together in ecologically sustainable fashion.

[^f151n2]: Phaeacia refers to Scheria, the island that Odysseus arrives at after his shipwreck; home of the Phaeacians. Whether Scheria corresponds to a real place is unclear, however.

[^f151n3]: Pomona was the Roman goddess of fruit.

[^f151n4]: Flora was the Roman goddess of springtime. 

[^f151n5]: The pineapple (*Ananas comosus*) originated in Central or South America. It was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean (Higman 188).  

[^f151n6]: Gilmore identifies this quotation as an adaptation from Milton's *Paradise Lost*.  

[^f151n7]: Shade.

[^f151n8]: The mammee apple (*Mammea americana*) is a large fruit native to the Caribbean and northern South America. 

[^f151n9]: An essence used as a flavouring for food and drink, typically extracted from almonds or the kernels of cherries, apricots, and peaches. 

[^f151n10]: The apricots of St. Domingue. St. Domingue was a French colony, renamed Haiti after a revolution led by enslaved and free people of African descent succeeded in overthrowing colonial rule in 1804.  

[^f151n11]: L'eau de noiaux refers to an alcoholic drink made by infusing a spirit with ratafia. Noyaux is the French term for the kernels of stone fruits.  

[^f151n12]: Laxative.  

[^f151n13]: Preserved or candied fruits.

- Thee, the first natives of these Ocean-isles,
- Fell anthropophagi,[^f152n1] still sacred held;
- And from thy large high-flavour'd fruit abstain'd, [505]
- With pious awe; for thine high-flavoured fruit,
- The airy phantoms of their friends deceas'd
- Joy'd to regale on.——Such their simple creed.
- The tamarind[^f152n2] likewise should adorn her theme,
- With whose tart fruit the sweltering fever loves [510]
- To quench his thirst, whose breezy umbrage soon
- Shades the pleas'd planter, shades his children long.
- Nor, lofty cassia,[^f152n3] should she not recount
- Thy woodland honours! See, what yellow flowers
- Dance in the gale, and scent the ambient air; [515]
- While thy long pods, full-fraught with nectared sweets,
- Relieve the bowels from their lagging load.
- Nor chirimoia,[^f152n4] though these torrid isles
- Boast not thy fruit, to which the anana yields
- In taste and flavour, wilt thou coy refuse [520]


> *&c.* is truly exquisite. This tree, contrary to most others in the New World, shoots up to a pyramidal figure: the leaves are uncommonly green; and it produces fruit, but once a year. The name is Indian. The English commonly call it *Mammey-sapota*. There are two species of it, the sweet, and the tart.[^f152n5] The botanical name is *Achras*.

> VER. 509. *tamarind*\] See Book I. p. 44.

> VER. 513. *cassia*,\] Both this tree and its mild purgative pulp are sufficiently known.


[^f152n1]: A term used in the ancient and medieval periods to signify man-eaters. It is now much less used than the term cannibal, which Columbus invented to name the Carib peoples that he encountered in the Americas. Columbus suggested that the Caribs were "Caniba" or subjects of the Great Khan, whose lands he was hoping to find. He also suggested that the Caribs ate human flesh, although there is little to no evidence that they actually did.  

[^f152n2]: The tamarind tree (*Tamarindicus indica*) is probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes.  

[^f152n3]: Cassia is probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka.  

[^f152n4]: *Annona cherimola*, a fruit that originated in South America and is perhaps native to Ecuador.  

[^f152n5]: The mammee sapota is actually different from the mammee apple (the fruit Grainger describes in lines 502-508). The mammee sapota (*Pouteria sapota*) is a sweet fruit whose native range is Mexico and Central America. Another fruit commonly confused with both the mammee sapota and the mammee apple is the nasebery (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the sapodilla or the nispero. It is a sour or tart fruit whose native range is Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (Higman 196-197).

- Thy fragrant shade to beautify the scene.
- But, chief of palms, and pride of Indian-groves,
- Thee, fair palmeto,[^f153n1] should her song resound:
- What swelling columns, form'd by Jones or Wren,[^f153n2]
- Or great Palladio,[^f153n3] may with thee compare? [525]
- Not nice-proportion'd, but of size immense,
- Swells the wild fig-tree,[^f153n4] and should claim her lay:
- For, from its numerous bearded twigs proceed
- A filial train, stupendous as their sire,
- In quick succession; and, o'er many a rood,[^f153n5] [530]
- Extend their uncouth limbs; which not the bolt
- Of heaven can scathe; nor yet the all-wasting rage


> VER. 523. *palmeto*,\] This being the most beautiful of palms, nay, perhaps, superior to any other known tree in the world, has with propriety obtained the name of *Royal*. The botanical name is *Palma Maxima*. It will shoot up perpendicularly to an hundred feet and more. The stem is perfectly circular; only towards the root, and immediately under the branches at top, it bulges out. The bark is smooth, and of an ash-brown colour, except at the top where it is green. It grows very fast, and the seed from whence it springs is not bigger than an acorn. In this, as in all the palm-genus, what the natives call *Cabbage* is found; but it resembles in taste an almond, and is in fact the pith of the upper, or greenish part of the stem. But it would be the most unpardonable luxury to cut down so lovely a tree, for so mean a gratification; especially as the wild, or mountain cabbage tree, sufficiently supplies the table with that esculent. I never ride past the charming vista of royal palms on the Cayon-estate of Daniel Mathew, Esq; in St. Christopher,[^f153n6] without being put in mind of the pillars of the Temple of the Sun at Palmyra.[^f153n7] This tree grows on the tops of hills, as well as in valleys; its hard cortical part makes very durable laths for houses.[^f153n8] There is a smaller species not quite so beautiful.


[^f153n1]: Grainger is referring to what he calls elsewhere the royal palm (*Roystonea oleracea*), which can reach forty meters in height and is native to the Lesser Antilles, northern South America, and Guatemala.

[^f153n2]: Inigo Jones (1573-1652) was an English architect and theatre designer. Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was an English architect, mathematician, and astronomer.  

[^f153n3]: Andrea Palladio (1508-1580), an Italian architect. 

[^f153n4]: Also known as the bearded fig or wild banyan tree (*Ficus citrifolia*). It is the national tree of Barbados, and its native range includes Florida and the tropical Americas.  

[^f153n5]: A rod, a unit used for measuring land approximately 5 1/2 yards (5.03 meters) in length. 

[^f153n6]: Mathew (1718-1777) was a cousin of Grainger's wife. Mathew's Cayon estate was in Saint Mary's parish on the western shore of St. Kitts. 

[^f153n7]: Also known as the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, an ancient city in Syria. Destroyed in 2015 by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  

[^f153n8]: Grainger is saying its bark can be used to make laths or strips of wood used in building.

- Of Typhon, or of hurricane, destroy.
- Nor should, tho' small, the anata[^f154n1] not be sung:
- Thy purple dye, the silk and cotton fleece [535]
- Delighted drink; thy purple dye the tribes
- Of Northern-Ind, a fierce and wily race,
- Carouse, assembled; and with it they paint
- Their manly make in many a horrid form,
- To add new terrors to the face of war. [540]
- The muse might teach to twine the verdant arch,
- And the cool alcove's lofty roof adorn,
- With ponderous granadillas,[^f154n2] and the fruit


> VER. 534. *anata*,\] Or *Anotto*, or *Arnotta*; thence corruptly called *Indian Otter*, by the English. The tree is about the size of an ordinary apple-tree. The French call it *Rocou*; and send the farina home as a paint, *&c.* for which purpose the tree is cultivated by them in their islands. The flower is pentapetalous, of a bluish and spoon-like appearance. The yellow filaments are tipped with purplish apices.[^f154n3] The style proves the rudiment of the succeeding pod, which is of a conic shape, an inch and a half long. This is divided into many cells, which contain a great number of small seeds, covered with a red farina.

> VER. 543. *granadilla*\] This is the Spanish name, and is a species of the *passiflora*, or passion-flower, called by Linnaeus *Musa*. The seeds and pulp, through which the seeds are dispersed, are cooling, and grateful to the palate. This, as well as the water-lemon, bell-apple, or honeysuckle, as it is named,[^f154n4] being parasitical plants, are easily formed into cooling arbors, than which nothing can be more grateful in warm climates. Both fruits are wholesome. The granadilla is commonly eat with sugar, on account of its tartness, and yet the pulp is viscid.[^f154n5] Plumier calls it *Granadilla*, *latefolia*, *fructu maliformi*. It grows best in shady places. The unripe fruit makes an excellent pickle.


[^f154n1]: Also anatta, anatto, or annatto. Refers to *Bixa orellana*, a low, shrubby tree native to the tropical Americas that was used from precolonial times by indigenous peoples to produce a reddish-orange dye. They used the dye to paint their faces and bodies for ornamental purposes, as well as to protect from insects and the sun.  

[^f154n2]: The passion fruit (*Passiflora ligularis*). Its native range is Panama to Venezuela and Peru.  

[^f154n3]: Apexes.  

[^f154n4]: Different names for *Passiflora laurifolia*, a passion fruit relative whose native range is the Caribbean to northern and northeastern Brazil.  

[^f154n5]: Sticky, adhesive.

- Call'd water-lemon; grateful to the taste:
- Nor should she not pursue the mountain-streams, [545]
- But pleas'd decoy them from their shady haunts,
- In rills, to visit every tree and herb;
- Or fall o'er fern-clad cliffs, with foaming rage;
- Or in huge basons[^f155n1] float, a fair expanse;
- Or, bound in chains of artificial force, [550]
- Arise thro' sculptured stone, or breathing brass.---
- But I'm in haste to furl my wind-worn sails,
- And anchor my tir'd vessel on the shore....


[^f155n1]: Basins.

> VER. 567. *Indian millet*\] Or maise. This is commonly called *Guinea-corn*, to distinguish it from the great or Indian-corn, that grows in the southern parts of North-America.[^f156n2] It soon shoots up to a great height, often twenty feet high, and will ratoon like the other; but its blades are not so nourishing to horses as those of the great corn, although its seeds are more so, and rather more agreeable to the taste. The Indians, Negroes, and poor white people, make many (not unsavoury) dishes with them. It is also called *Turkey wheat*. The turpentine tree[^f156n3] will also grow in the sand, and is most useful upon a plantation. 

[^f156n1]: By Indian millet, Grainger means Guinea corn (*Sorghum bicolor*). Often planted in the provision grounds of the enslaved and a key source of food, as indicated by an eighteenth-century song sung by the enslaved that declares, "Guinea Corn, I long to see you/Guinea Corn, I long to plant you/Guinea Corn, I long to mould you/Guinea Corn, I long to weed you...Guinea Corn, I long to eat you" (qtd. in Higman 231). 

[^f156n2]: Maize, great corn, and Indian corn are all different names for *Zea mays*.

[^f156n3]: Likely *Bursera simaruba*, a tree whose native range is the Caribbean and Mexico to Brazil.
