## Animals

In Book II of *The Sugar-Cane*, James Grainger forewarns his readers of a peril to Torrid Zone plantations; that being animals. Whether referring to monkeys, rats, or a myriad of insect species, the speaker includes several references to the quotidian inconveniences and setbacks that animals pose to planters' economic, and consequently social, wellbeing. With crops becoming "devour'd" (II, 166), readers can see the consequences of unchecked animal presences on plantations. Beyond the practical knowledge of plantation vulnerabilities in the face of animal life, animals can additionally be interpreted as one of Grainger's tools to unearth more than just agricultural facets of plantation life.

Referring to some insects as being "From distant islands" (II, 163) and being of "insect-tribes" (II, 156), Grainger utilizes language that keenly elicits ideas of foreign lands; specifically Africa (as "Afric" becomes an explicitly used term). With these double meanings comes a sort of invitation to think of these animal descriptions as more than just verbal demonstrations of the physical world. Such a practice of tapping into an animal's cultural or ideological significances existed and was known as emblematic natural history. 

Writers of natural histories during the Renaissance through the eighteenth-century did not rely solely on empirical data (as is the practice of modern-day natural sciences). Emblematic natural history often took into account the symbolic and metaphorical associations that a culture attached to elements of the natural world. For instance, societies often associate the abstract notions of being sly, sneaky, or cunning with foxes. These associations could be found side-by-side with more empirical, visual, and verifiable observations of an animal or other part of the natural world. This cultural projection of abstract meaning onto nature can lead to a consequent projection of a society's fears, hopes, dreams, etc. Tenets of emblematic natural history could exist in parts of Book II, and they can reveal Grainger's work as more than just a manual about plantation management.

If the animals and insects of the plantation can come to signify more than just the actual fauna of St. Kitt's, then the descriptions of assembled animal populations can come to be important elements of Book II. As we have seen earlier, Grainger describes assembled insects as in "tribes," and he also refers to "[B]ugs, confederate in destructive league" (II, 228). The poet mentions "The ants' republic...a villain crew" (II, 229) as well as rats, or as he describes them, "A countless clan" that "despoil the low-land Cane" (II, 63). Monkeys are not without a specific adjective of assemblage, as Grainger warns his readers, "Destructive, on the upland sugar-groves / The monkey-nation preys..." (II, 34-35). The political terms that accompany animal groupings can signify deeper meanings of these plantation intruders. Europeans' familiarity with certain kinds of animal can also affect the terms used to describe their groupings. Grainger's specific and varied language used to describe animal grouping reflects a preoccupation with assembly, and it could be for a good reason.

Fear of slave gatherings and slave revolts were feasible and apparent threats during the years in which Grainger lived and wrote. Tacky's Revolt on the island of Jamaica was one of the crucial slave revolts of the eighteenth-century Caribbean world and occurred only four years previous to Grainger's 1764 edition of *The Sugar-Cane* (see "Obeah"). Before Tacky's Revolt, there was a slave insurrection on the island of St. John in 1733, and slave revolts continued even after the publication of Grainger's poem. From August of 1791 to January of 1804, the Haitian Slave Revolt took place, marking the continued decline of white plantation-owner power in the region. The steady breakdown of traditional plantation hierarchy was a realistic threat that did occur, but to acknowledge this fear and disempowerment was to, in a way, also admit a sentiment of defeat. The ability to assemble is foundational to revolts and revolutions, and the preoccupation with the ways in which animals group themselves can open this text up to significances beyond the cultivation of the ideal sugar plantation.

Grainger's descriptions of animal threats to sugar plantations become methods through which the author and readers can explore the struggles and doubts that plantation owners developed. When reading the following excerpts, we can more fully understand the uncertainties of slave-owning and the fear of the enslaved by approaching the text with a few focusing questions. How are depictions of animal metaphorical, and is there enough continuity among metaphors to consider allegorical relationships between the natural world and populations on plantations? How do depictions of animal subscribe to qualities of emblematic natural history? How do the words used to describe animal groupings change a reader's idea of the animal? Why would Grainger change grouping terms depending on the animal or insect, especially if it is not a common or scientific term used to refer to groups of a specific species? Why could Grainger have chosen to use more subtle means to comment on the organization of humans in the plantation system, as opposed to more explicit ways?

- \"O WERE my pipe as soft, my dittied song\"[^f54n2]  
- As smooth as thine, my too too distant friend, [30]  
- SHENSTONE; my soft pipe, and my dittied song  
- Should hush the hurricanes tremendous roar,  
- And from each evil guard the ripening Cane!
  

[^f54n2]: Gilmore identifies this quotation as an adaptation from Milton's *Comus* (l.86).

- DESTRUCTIVE, on the upland sugar-groves  
- The monkey-nation[^f55n1] preys: from rocky heights, [35]  
- In silent parties, they descend by night,  
- And posting watchful sentinels, to warn  
- When hostile steps approach; with gambols,[^f55n2] they  
- Pour o'er the Cane-grove. Luckless he to whom  
- That land pertains! in evil hour, perhaps, [40]  
- And thoughtless of to-morrow, on a die  
- He hazards millions; or, perhaps, reclines  
- On Luxury's soft lap, the pest of wealth;  
- And, inconsiderate, deems his Indian crops[^f55n3]  
- Will amply her insatiate wants supply.[^f55n4] [45]  

- FROM these insidious droles[^f55n5] \(peculiar pest  
- Of Liamuiga's[^f55n6] hills\) would'st thou defend  
- Thy waving wealth; in traps put not thy trust,  
- However baited: Treble every watch,  
- And well with arms provide them; faithful dogs, [50]  
- Of nose sagacious, on their footsteps wait.  

> VER. 46. *peculiar pest*\] The monkeys which are now so numerous in the mountainous parts of St. Christopher, were brought thither by the French when they possessed half that island. This circumstance we learn from *Pere Labat*,[^f55n7] who farther tells us, that they are a most delicate food. The English-Negroes are very fond of them, but the White-inhabitants do not eat them. They do a great deal of mischief in St. Kitts, destroying many thousand pounds *Sterling*'s worth of Canes every year.

[^f55n1]: Monkeys are not indigenous to St. Kitts, but the vervet or African green monkey (*Cercopithecus aethiops*) had been introduced by the seventeenth century. Vervets most likely arrived in the Caribbean via slave ships from Africa. They quickly came to be considered pests because they established themselves in large numbers on the island and traveled around it in troops, raiding colonists' crops. Today, the St. Kitts vervet population exceeds the human one, and vervets are still known for destroying farmers' crops (and stealing tourists' cocktails). Controversially, many of the vervets are now killed or trapped to serve in medical experiments.  

[^f55n2]: Leaps or capers, as made in dancing or playing.  

[^f55n3]: Sugar. 

[^f55n4]: Grainger warns that despite the fact that sugar plantations seem like sure investments with guaranteed profits, they nevertheless require expert knowledge and labor to succeed.   

[^f55n5]: Also droll, a buffoon or jester.  

[^f55n6]: Indigenous name for St. Kitts.  

[^f55n7]: Jean Baptiste Labat (1663-1738), French missionary of the Dominican order who served as a priest and procurator in Martinique and Guadaloupe. Libertated the island of Martinique from British control in 1703. Later, a professor of philosophy and mathematics in Nancy, France, and author of the *Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Amerique* (1722).

- With these attack the predatory bands;  
- Quickly the unequal conflict they decline,  
- And, chattering, fling their ill-got spoils away.  
- So when, of late, innumerous Gallic hosts[^f56n1] [55]  
- Fierce, wanton, cruel, did by stealth invade  
- The peaceable American's domains,  
- While desolation mark'd their faithless rout;  
- No sooner Albion's[^f56n2] martial sons advanc'd,  
- Than the gay dastards to their forests fled, [60]  
- And left their spoils and tomahawks behind.  

- NOR with less waste the whisker'd vermine-race,[^f56n3] 
- A countless clan, despoil the low-land Cane.  

- THESE to destroy, while commerce hoists the sail,  
- Loose rocks abound, or tangling bushes bloom, [65]  
- What Planter knows?—Yet prudence may reduce.  
- Encourage then the breed of savage cats,  

> VER. 64. *These to destroy*\] Rats, *&c.* are not natives of America, but came by shipping from Europe. They breed in the ground, under loose rocks and bushes. Durante, a Roman, who was physician to Pope Sixtus Quintus,[^f56n4] and who wrote a Latin poem on the preservation of health, enumerates domestic rats among animals that may be eaten with safety. But if these are wholesome, cane-rats must be much more delicate, as well as more nourishing. Accordingly we find most field Negroes fond of them, and I have heard that straps of cane-rats are publicly sold in the markets of Jamaica.[^f56n5]

[^f56n1]: Hostile French forces. Here, Grainger makes an analogy between the vervet monkeys and the French during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), the first truly global war that resulted in the establishment of Britain as the preeminent maritime and colonial power.

[^f56n2]: Albion, a name of ancient Celtic origin for Britain or England. The term may also derive from the Latin word for white (*albus*) and refer to the white cliffs of Dover.

[^f56n3]: Refers either to the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) or the brown rat (*Rattus norvegicus*), two Old World species of rats that arrived in the Caribbean with colonization and are now considered invasive species. There also was a rat known as the Nevis rice rat (*Pennatomys nivalis*) that was native to Nevis, St. Kitts, and St. Eustatius, but there are no definitive reports of its existence from the colonial era. The Nevis rice rat is now considered extinct. This line of the poem also relates to one of the most famous and perhaps apocryphal stories about the reception and publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. In his *Life of Johnson*, James Boswell recalls a reading of a manuscript draft of the poem that took place at the home of painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The line, "Now, Muse, let's sing of *rats*," is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. In response, Grainger deleted the word "rats" from the poem and replaced it with "whisker'd vermine-race" (Irlam 390-391). 

[^f56n4]: Castore Durante da Gualdo (1529-1590), botanist and physician to the Popes Gregory XIII and Sixtus V. Author of *Herbaria nuovo* (1585) and *Il tesoro della sanità* (1586).

[^f56n5]: Grainger may have been referring to a passage from Hans Sloane's *A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica* (1707, 1725) that reads, "Rats are likewise sold by the dozen, and when they have been bred amongst the Sugar-Canes, are thought by some discerning people very delicious Victuals" (1.xx). Sloane seems to imply that all Jamaicans, and not just the enslaved, ate rats.

- STILL other maladies infest the Cane, [155]
- And worse to be subdu'd. The insect-tribe[^f63n2]
- That, fluttering, spread their pinions to the sun,
- Recal the muse: nor shall their many eyes,
- Tho' edg'd with gold, their many-colour'd down,
- From Death preserve them. In what distant clime, [160]
- In what recesses are the plunderers hatch'd?
- Say, are they wasted in the living gale,
- From distant islands? Thus, the locust-breed,
- In winged caravans, that blot the sky,
- Descend from far, and, ere bright morning dawn,
- Astonish'd Afric sees her crop devour'd. [165]
- Or, doth the Cane a proper nest afford,

[^f63n2]: Locusts, one of several species of acridids (family Acrididae) that are known for swarming and migrating and causing great damage to crops.

- But YE, base insects! no bright scarlet yield,
- To deck the British Wolf;[^f64n2] who now, perhaps, [175]
- (So Heaven and George[^f64n3] ordain) in triumph mounts
- Some strong-built fortress, won from haughty Gaul!
- And tho' no plant such luscious nectar yields,
- As yields the Cane-plant; yet, vile paricides![^f64n4]
- Ungrateful ye! the Parent-cane destroy. [180] 

[^f64n2]: James Wolfe (1727-1759), English army officer. Like Grainger, he served in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and during the Scottish Jacobite Rising of 1745. Appointed Major-General in North America in 1758, Wolfe is perhaps best known for defeating French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, marquis de Montcalm, and the French army on the Plains of Abraham outside of Quebec city in September 1759. Wolfe was fatally wounded during the battle, but his victory brought an end to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763).  

[^f64n3]: George III (1738-1820), king of Britain from 1760 to 1820.

[^f64n4]: Father killer. Here, Grainger refers to parasites—and perhaps puns on the similarities between "paracide" and "parasite"—that kill the plants on which they feed (in this case, the sugar cane). Grainger may be referring to the sugar cane borer (*Diatraea saccharalis*), a moth native to South and Central America whose larvae bore holes in sugar cane plants and do great damage on plantations.

- Innumerous as the leaves the plumb-tree[^f66n2] sheds,
- When, proud of her faecundity, she shows,
- Naked, her gold fruit to the God of noon. [220]
- Remorseless to its youth; what pity, say,
- Can the Cane's age expect? In vain, its pith
- With juice nectarious flows; to pungent sour,
- Foe to the bowels, soon its nectar turns:
- Vain every joint a gemmy[^f66n3] embryo bears, [225]
- Alternate rang'd; from these no filial young
- Shall grateful spring, to bless the planter's eye.—
- With bugs confederate, in destructive league,
- The ants' republic[^f66n4] joins; a villain crew,

> VER. 218. *the plumb-tree sheds*,\] This is the Jamaica plumb-tree. When covered with fruit, it has no leaves upon it. The fruit is wholesome. In like manner, the panspan[^f66n5] is destitute of foliage when covered with flowers. The latter is a species of jessamine, and grows as large as an apple-tree.

[^f66n2]: According to Gilmore, *Spondias purpurea*. Its native range is Mexico to northern Colombia.  

[^f66n3]: Gem-like, brilliant, glittering.

[^f66n4]: Ant colonies were often represented as model republics in early modern and eighteenth-century accounts because of their ability to work together for the collective good. For example, in his *True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados* (1657), Richard Ligon observed that he once put a pot filled with sugar in the middle of a larger dish of water to see whether the ants would be able to find and retrieve the sugar. As he reported, the ants began venturing into the water even though they could not swim, so that their dead bodies could form a bridge for the others to use to access the sugar. The ants thereby "neglect[ed] their lives for the good of the publique" (64).
