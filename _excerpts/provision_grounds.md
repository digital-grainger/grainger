## Provision Grounds

[147]({{site.baseurl}}/images/p0161.jpg)

- HOWE'ER insensate some may deem their slaves,
- Nor 'bove the bestial rank; far other thoughts
- The muse, soft daughter of humanity!
- Will ever entertain.—The Ethiop knows,
- The Ethiop feels, when treated like a man; [425]
- Nor grudges, should necessity compell,
- By day, by night, to labour for his lord.

- NOT less inhuman, than unthrifty those;
- Who, half the year's rotation round the sun,
- Deny subsistence to their labouring slaves. [430]
- But would'st thou see thy negroe-train encrease,
- Free from disorders; and thine acres clad
- With groves of sugar: every week dispense
- Or English beans, or Carolinian rice;
- Iërne's beef, or Pensilvanian flour; [435]
- Newfoundland cod, or herrings from the main
- That howls tempestuous round the Scotian isles!

- YET some there are so lazily inclin'd,
- And so neglectful of their food, that thou,
- Would'st thou preserve them from the jaws of death; [440]
- Daily, their wholesome viands must prepare:
- With these let all the young, and childless old,

- And all the morbid share;—so heaven will bless,
- With manifold encrease, thy costly care.

- SUFFICE not this; to every slave assign [445]
- Some mountain-ground: or, if waste broken land
- To thee belong, that broken land divide.
- This let them cultivate, one day, each week;
- And there raise yams, and there cassada's root:
- From a good daemon's staff cassada sprang, [450]
- Tradition says, and Caribbees believe;
- Which into three the white-rob'd genius broke,
- And bade them plant, their hunger to repel.
- There let angola's bloomy bush supply,
- For many a year, with wholesome pulse their board. [455]
- There let the bonavist, his fringed pods

> VER. 449. *cassada*\] To an antient Carribean, bemoaning the savage uncomfortable life of his countrymen, a deity clad in white apparel appeared, and told him, he would have come sooner to have taught him the ways of civil life, had he been addressed before. He then showed him sharp-cutting stones to fell trees and build houses; and bade him cover them with the palm leaves. Then he broke his staff in three; which, being planted, soon after produced cassada. See Ogilvy's America.

> VER. 454. *angola*\] This is called *Pidgeon-pea*, and grows on a sturdy shrub, that will last for years. It is justly reckoned among the most wholesome legumens. The juice of the leaves, dropt into the eye, will remove incipient films. The botanic name is *Cytisus*.

> VER. 456. *bonavist*\] This is the Spanish name of a plant, which produces an excellent bean. It is a parasitical plant. There are five sorts of bonavist, the green, the white, the

- Throw liberal o'er the prop; while ochra bears
- Aloft his slimy pulp, and help disdains.
- There let potatos mantle o'er the ground;
- Sweet as the cane-juice is the root they bear. [460]
- There too let eddas spring in order meet,
- With Indian cale, and foodful calaloo:
- While mint, thyme, balm, and Europe's coyer herbs,
- Shoot gladsome forth, nor reprobate the clime.

> moon-shine, the small or common; and, lastly, the black and red. The flowers of all are white and papilionaceous; except the last, whose blossoms are purple. They commonly bear in six weeks. Their pulse is wholesome, though somewhat flatulent; especially those from the black and red. The pods are flattish, two or three inches long; and contain from three to five seeds in partitional cells.

> VER. 457. *Ochra*\] Or *Ockro*. This shrub, which will last for years, produces a not less agreeable, than wholesome pod. It bears all the year round. Being of a slimy and balsamic nature, it becomes a truly medicinal aliment in dysenteric complaints. It is of the *Malva* species. It rises to about four or five feet high, bearing, on and near the summit, many yellow flowers; succeeded by green, conic, fleshy pods, channelled into several grooves. There are as many cells filled with small round seeds, as there are channels.

> VER. 459. *potatos*\] I cannot positively say, whether these vines are of Indian original or not; but as in their fructification, they differ from potatos at home, they probably are not European. They are sweet. There are four kinds, the red, the white, the long, and round: The juice of each may be made into a pleasant cool drink; and, being distilled, yield an excellent spirit.

> VER. 461. *eddas*\] See notes on Book I. The French call this plant *Tayove*. It produces eatable roots every four months, for one year only.

> VER. 462. *Indian cale*\] This green, which is a native of the New World, equals any of the greens in the Old.

> VER. 462. *calaloo*\] Another species of Indian pot-herb, no less wholesome than the preceding. These, with mezamby, and the Jamaica prickle-weed, yield to no esculent plants in Europe. This is an Indian name.

- THIS tract secure, with hedges or of limes, [465]
- Or bushy citrons, or the shapely tree
- That glows at once with aromatic blooms,
- And golden fruit mature. To these be join'd,
- In comely neighbourhood, the cotton shrub;
- In this delicious clime the cotton bursts [470]
- On rocky soils.—The coffee also plant;
- White as the skin of Albion's lovely fair,
- Are the thick snowy fragrant blooms it boasts:
- Nor wilt thou, cocô, thy rich pods refuse;
- Tho' years, and heat, and moisture they require, [475]
- Ere the stone grind them to the food of health.
- Of thee, perhaps, and of thy various sorts,
- And that kind sheltering tree, thy mother nam'd,
- With crimson flowerets prodigally grac'd;
- In future times, the enraptur'd muse may sing: [480]
- If public favour crown her present lay.

- BUT let some antient, faithful slave erect
- His sheltered mansion near; and with his dog,
- His loaded gun, and cutlass, guard the whole:
- Else negro-fugitives, who skulk 'mid rocks [485]

> VER. 466. *the shapely tree*\] The orange tree.

- And shrubby wilds, in bands will soon destroy
- Thy labourer's honest wealth; their loss and yours.

- Perhaps, of Indian gardens I could sing,
- Beyond what bloom'd on blest Phaeacia's isle,
- Or eastern climes admir'd in days of yore: [490]
- How Europe's foodful, culinary plants;
- How gay Pomona's ruby-tinctured births;
- And gawdy Flora's various-vested train;
- Might be instructed to unlearn their clime,
- And by due discipline adopt the sun. [495]
- The muse might tell what culture will entice
- The ripened melon, to perfume each month;
- And with the anana load the fragrant board.
- The muse might tell, what trees will best exclude
- ("Insuperable height of airiest shade") [500]
- With their vast umbrage the noon's fervent ray.
- Thee, verdant mammey, first, her song should praise:

> VER. 502. *mammey*\] This is a lofty, shady, and beautiful tree. Its fruit is as large as the largest melon, and of an exquisite smell, greatly superior to it in point of taste. Within the fruit are contained one or two large stones, which when distilled, give to spirits a ratafia flavour, and therefore the French call them *Les apricots de St. Domingue*: accordingly, the *l'eau des noiaux*, one of the best West-Indian cordials, is made from them. The fruit, eaten raw, is of an aperient quality; and made into sweet-meats,

- Thee, the first natives of these Ocean-isles,
- Fell anthropophagi, still sacred held;
- And from thy large high-flavour'd fruit abstain'd, [505]
- With pious awe; for thine high-flavoured fruit,
- The airy phantoms of their friends deceas'd
- Joy'd to regale on.——Such their simple creed.
- The tamarind likewise should adorn her theme,
- With whose tart fruit the sweltering fever loves [510]
- To quench his thirst, whose breezy umbrage soon
- Shades the pleas'd planter, shades his children long.
- Nor, lofty cassia, should she not recount
- Thy woodland honours! See, what yellow flowers
- Dance in the gale, and scent the ambient air; [515]
- While thy long pods, full-fraught with nectared sweets,
- Relieve the bowels from their lagging load.
- Nor chirimoia, though these torrid isles
- Boast not thy fruit, to which the anana yields
- In taste and flavour, wilt thou coy refuse [520]

> *&c.* is truly exquisite. This tree, contrary to most others in the New World, shoots up to a pyramidal figure: the leaves are uncommonly green; and it produces fruit, but once a year. The name is Indian. The English commonly call it *Mammey-sapota*. There are two species of it, the sweet, and the tart. The botanical name is *Achras*.

> VER. 509. *tamarind*\] See Book I. p. 44.

> VER. 513. *cassia*,\] Both this tree and its mild purgative pulp are sufficiently known.

- Thy fragrant shade to beautify the scene.
- But, chief of palms, and pride of Indian-groves,
- Thee, fair palmeto, should her song resound:
- What swelling columns, form'd by Jones or Wren,
- Or great Palladio, may with thee compare? [525]
- Not nice-proportion'd, but of size immense,
- Swells the wild fig-tree, and should claim her lay:
- For, from its numerous bearded twigs proceed
- A filial train, stupendous as their sire,
- In quick succession; and, o'er many a rood, [530]
- Extend their uncouth limbs; which not the bolt
- Of heaven can scathe; nor yet the all-wasting rage

> VER. 523. *palmeto*,\] This being the most beautiful of palms, nay, perhaps, superior to any other known tree in the world, has with propriety obtained the name of *Royal*. The botanical name is *Palma Maxima*. It will shoot up perpendicularly to an hundred feet and more. The stem is perfectly circular; only towards the root, and immediately under the branches at top, it bulges out. The bark is smooth, and of an ash-brown colour, except at the top where it is green. It grows very fast, and the seed from whence it springs is not bigger than an acorn. In this, as in all the palm-genus, what the natives call *Cabbage* is found; but it resembles in taste an almond, and is in fact the pith of the upper, or greenish part of the stem. But it would be the most unpardonable luxury to cut down so lovely a tree, for so mean a gratification; especially as the wild, or mountain cabbage tree, sufficiently supplies the table with that esculent. I never ride past the charming vista of royal palms on the Cayon-estate of Daniel Mathew, Esq; in St. Christopher, without being put in mind of the pillars of the Temple of the Sun at Palmyra. This tree grows on the tops of hills, as well as in valleys; its hard cortical part makes very durable laths for houses. There is a smaller species not quite so beautiful.

- Of Typhon, or of hurricane, destroy.
- Nor should, tho' small, the anata not be sung:
- Thy purple dye, the silk and cotton fleece [535]
- Delighted drink; thy purple dye the tribes
- Of Northern-Ind, a fierce and wily race,
- Carouse, assembled; and with it they paint
- Their manly make in many a horrid form,
- To add new terrors to the face of war. [540]
- The muse might teach to twine the verdant arch,
- And the cool alcove's lofty roof adorn,
- With ponderous granadillas, and the fruit

> VER. 534. *anata*,\] Or *Anotto*, or *Arnotta*; thence corruptly called *Indian Otter*, by the English. The tree is about the size of an ordinary apple-tree. The French call it *Rocou*; and send the farina home as a paint, *&c.* for which purpose the tree is cultivated by them in their islands. The flower is pentapetalous, of a bluish and spoon-like appearance. The yellow filaments are tipped with purplish apices. The style proves the rudiment of the succeeding pod, which is of a conic shape, an inch and a half long. This is divided into many cells, which contain a great number of small seeds, covered with a red farina.

> VER. 543. *granadilla*\] This is the Spanish name, and is a species of the *passiflora*, or passion-flower, called by Linnaeus *Musa*. The seeds and pulp, through which the seeds are dispersed, are cooling, and grateful to the palate. This, as well as the water-lemon, bell-apple, or honeysuckle, as it is named, being parasitical plants, are easily formed into cooling arbors, than which nothing can be more grateful in warm climates. Both fruits are wholesome. The granadilla is commonly eat with sugar, on account of its tartness, and yet the pulp is viscid. Plumier calls it *Granadilla*, *latefolia*, *fructu maliformi*. It grows best in shady places. The unripe fruit makes an excellent pickle.

- Call'd water-lemon; grateful to the taste:
- Nor should she not pursue the mountain-streams, [545]
- But pleas'd decoy them from their shady haunts,
- In rills, to visit every tree and herb;
- Or fall o'er fern-clad cliffs, with foaming rage;
- Or in huge basons float, a fair expanse;
- Or, bound in chains of artificial force, [550]
- Arise thro' sculptured stone, or breathing brass.---
- But I'm in haste to furl my wind-worn sails,
- And anchor my tir'd vessel on the shore.

- IT much imports to build thy Negroe-huts,
- Or on the sounding margin of the main, [555]
- Or on some dry hill's gently-sloping sides,
- In streets, at distance due.——When near the beach,
- Let frequent coco cast its wavy shade;
- \'Tis Neptune's tree; and, nourish'd by the spray,
- Soon round the bending stem's aerial height, [560]
- Clusters of mighty nuts, with milk and fruit
- Delicious fraught, hang clattering in the sky.
- There let the bay-grape, too, its crooked limbs

- Its frequent clusters glow. And there, if thou [565]
- Would'st make the sand yield salutary food,
- Let Indian millet rear its corny reed,
- Like arm'd battalions in array of war.
- But, round the upland huts, bananas plant;
- A wholesome nutriment bananas yield, [570]
- And sun-burnt labour loves its breezy shade.
- Their graceful screen let kindred plantanes join,
- And with their broad vans shiver in the breeze;
- So flames design'd, or by imprudence caught,
- Shall spread no ruin to the neighbouring roof. [575]

> circular;\) and succeeds best in sandy places. It bears large clusters of grapes once a year; which, when ripe, are not disagreeable. The stones, seeds, or *acini*, contained in them, are large in proportion; and, being reduced to a powder, are an excellent astringent. The bark of the tree has the same property. The grapes, steept in water and fermented with sugar, make an agreeable wine.

> VER. 567. *Indian millet*\] Or maise. This is commonly called *Guinea-corn*, to distinguish it from the great or Indian-corn, that grows in the southern parts of North-America. It soon shoots up to a great height, often twenty feet high, and will ratoon like the other; but its blades are not so nourishing to horses as those of the great corn, although its seeds are more so, and rather more agreeable to the taste. The Indians, Negroes, and poor white people, make many (not unsavoury) dishes with them. It is also called *Turkey wheat*. The turpentine tree will also grow in the sand, and is most useful upon a plantation.
