# Poetry and Slavery

## Origins of the poem: who was Grainger; why did he write *The Sugar-Cane*?

James Grainger was a Scottish poet who practiced as a physician on a sugar plantation in St Kitts. Born between 1721 and 1724 in Duns, he studied medicine at Edinburgh University and served in the army as a surgeon from 1745 to 1748. After settling in London as a practicing physician, he became friends with various literary authors, including Samuel Johnson, Tobias Smollett, and Thomas Percy. Between 1755 and 1759, Grainger published poems, medical papers, and drama reviews. His translation of the works of Roman poet Tibullus resulted in a literary feud with Smollett after the latter's critical review. In 1759, Grainger began a tour of the West Indies, where he married Miss Burt, a member of a prominent planter family. In St Kitts, he managed the estate of his wife's uncle, continuing to practice medicine on the island. It was during patient rounds that Grainger composed *The Sugar-Cane*, which was completed in 1762. The first and only edition of the poem was published in London in May 1764. Later that year, he published a supplementary *Essay on the more common West India diseases*, which expands upon the footnotes of the poem. The poem was intended to instruct the planter class in the proper cultivation of sugar cane and was meant to be read as a poetic manual. <!--comment on book IV?--> Grainger died in St Kitts 1766.


## What is *The Sugar-Cane*; what is a georgic and a West-India georgic?




## Why produce a digital edition? What does it mean to read poetry about slavery? 

While Grainger's poem was intended as a guide to planting sugar, it also describes the uses of numerous other plants, read by scholars for evidence of Afro-Caribbean ecological knowledge, survival, and resistance. A digital edition of *The Sugar-Cane* works to highlight these references to provision grounds, obeah, and indigenous knowledge, to name a few, with the goal of complicating Grainger's narrative of empire and British prosperity. By including our own editorial footnotes, we seek to contextualize Grainger's meager references to Afro-Caribbean expertise. Additionally, by providing what we have called "The Counter-Plantation," we have highlighted themes like indigenous botanical knowledge, obeah, provision grounds, and climate to de-center Grainger as the singular authority of the plantation space. This section of the site excerpts moments from the poem and includes an introduction and guiding questions to the passages designed to facilitate imagining the poem as a site of counter-plantation. 


## What kind of edition is this? How is it supposed to be used?

*Digital Grainger* includes three versions of the poem: the first, a full-text option that includes *The Sugar-Cane* in its entirety on one page; the second, a page-by-page option that includes image links to a 1764 edition of the text; the third, the excerpts and descriptions included in "The Counter-Plantation." Each of these versions include Grainger's original footnotes as well as supplemental editorial footnotes. We invite you to explore each reading experience to consider how rearranging and excerpting the poem registers different forms of agency and authority within the contact zone of the West Indies.
