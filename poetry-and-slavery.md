# Poetry and Slavery 

First published in London in 1764, James Grainger’s *The Sugar-Cane* was a widely circulated poem in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There were two more editions of it that came out in London and Dublin in 1766; magazines and anthologies also reprinted excerpts of the poem. Audiences around the British Atlantic world considered Grainger’s poem essential reading because Grainger used it to describe Caribbean sugar plantations, which, by the mid-eighteenth century, were the primary economic engines of the British Empire. 

Our goal in providing readers with this digital edition of Grainger's poem is not to encourage readings that celebrate the might of empire, however. As scholars have amply documented, the productivity of Caribbean plantations rested upon the exploitative employment of enslaved laborers, who were forcibly transported from Africa to the Caribbean to cultivate sugar. As scholars also have realized, however, *The Sugar-Cane* can potentially serve as a valuable source of information about not only the sugar-slavery complex but also the everyday lives of the enslaved. The latter topic is one that Grainger addresses, in fact, on many occasions in the poem and particularly in footnotes, often lengthy, that he added to his lines of poetry. These footnotes contain extensive descriptions of Caribbean flora, which Grainger's profession as a physician and interest in using plants for medicinal purposes had made him familiar with. In addition to describing individual plants, the footnotes include information about the uses made of plants by the Caribbean's inhabitants, including Afro-Caribbean and indigenous peoples. As such, our hope is that readers can use this edition to understand some of the strategies of subsistence, survival, and resistance employed by the enslaved and other marginalized subjects within plantation colonies. 

Nevertheless, reading the poem today poses certain political and aesthetic challenges. First, Grainger intended *The Sugar-Cane* to be an endorsement of the Caribbean plantation system: as the poem's sentiments make clear, Grainger was emphatically interested both in Britain's prosperity and in the continuation of slavery, which he believed simply needed to be reformed, not abolished. Second, Grainger wrote *The Sugar-Cane* as a georgic, a poetic genre unfamiliar to the vast majority of present-day readers. The footnotes, too, are often difficult to decipher, since they frequently assume specialized knowledge of scientific terms and names.  

What we hope to do in this brief introduction to *The Sugar-Cane*, then, is to provide essential background information on Grainger and the georgic so that readers can better understand and engage with the poem. At the same time, we seek to raise questions about Grainger's decision to depict slavery via the medium of poetry. We particularly seek to question his defense of the plantation system at a time when some of his contemporaries were beginning to embrace the idea of abolition. Finally, we discuss the strategies we employed in this edition to try and make dissenting readings of the poem--ones that focus on what could be called the "counter-plantation," versus the plantation--available to users of this site. 


## Who Was Grainger?

James Grainger was destined for neither literary nor scientific greatness. Like so many other eighteenth-century British men, however, he was able to navigate the commercial and intellectual networks that were opened by Britain's expanding imperial and colonial endeavors. Grainger was born in the mid-1720s in Duns, a small town near Scotland's southern border with England. His father bankrupted himself with a series of failed investments, and young James was orphaned around the age of ten. He was placed under the guardianship of his half-brother William, apprenticed to an Edinburgh surgeon soon afterward, and enrolled in 1739 to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which was already on its way to becoming a center of the global Enlightenment. His career trajectory from there was fairly typical for a man of his background: he enlisted as a regimental surgeon in the mid-1740s and then served in Scotland during the Jacobite uprising (1745) and in the Netherlands during the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748). Upon his return to civilian life, he wrote a dissertation on the treatment of syphilis that was published in 1753, and he moved to London to practice medicine in the mid-1750s.

The move to London brought Grainger into the heart of Britain's literary world. He soon made friends with literati like Samuel Johnson, Bishop Thomas Percy, Oliver Goldsmith, William Shenstone, and Charlotte Lennox, all of whom would figure in *The Sugar-Cane* and some of whom also helped Grainger revise and publish it. Before *The Sugar-Cane* appeared and during his years in London, Grainger published several short poems, reviews, and a longer translation of Tibullus (ca. 55-19 BCE). Nevertheless, he struggled financially. Concluding that he would never make his fortune independently, he resolved to take on a patron. That patron would be his 21-year-old former pupil, John Bourryau (ca. 1737-1769). Grainger and Bourryau's patronage agreement would pay the poet a £200 annuity upon his return from a four-year voyage, during which he would accompany Bourryau to the continent and to St. Kitts, where Bourryau had recently inherited a sugar estate.

Bourryau and Grainger left for the Caribbean in the spring of 1759. During the crossing, Grainger was called upon to treat a woman who had contracted smallpox. As he nursed her back to health, he made the acquaintance of the woman's daughter, Daniel Matthew Burt, and Grainger and Burt were married soon after their arrival in St. Kitts. Having decided to remain in the Caribbean in order to establish himself as a physician, Grainger annulled his patronage agreement with Bourryau. Moreover, because Burt came from a family of wealthy planters, Grainger soon became a plantation physician, a potentially lucrative position that he hoped would eventually allow him to establish his own plantation. He also decided to write a long poem about the Caribbean soon after his arrival in St. Kitts, and he completed an early draft of *The Sugar-Cane* by 1762, when he sent it off to Percy for comments. The first edition of the poem was published in 1764, the same year that his prose *Essay on the More Common West India Diseases* appeared in print. In 1764, Percy also included Grainger's "Bryan and Pereene, a West-Indian Ballad" in *Reliques of Ancient English Poetry*.

Grainger complained bitterly about the isolation he felt in St. Kitts and about what he saw as his fellow colonists' lack of culture. Nevertheless, he only returned to England briefly in 1763, perhaps in part to help supervise the publication of *The Sugar-Cane*.  He died in St. Kitts in December 1766, leaving behind his wife and a young daughter named Louise. At the end of the eighteenth century, his friend Thomas Percy collaborated with Robert Anderson to produce a collection of his works, which did not appear, however, until 1836.


## Why a Georgic?

Taking its name from the Greek word for agriculture, the georgic is one of the major classical poetic genres alongside the epic (which treats heroic events) and the pastoral (which treats the rural lives of shepherds). In the eyes of eighteenth-century British readers, the most famous and most praised poem in the georgic genre was Virgil's *Georgics* (ca. 29 BCE). Split into four books, the georgic aims both to instruct readers in the art of agriculture (including planting and animal husbandry) and to praise the effects of agricultural labor on farmers and society. John Dryden led a resurgence of interest in the georgic when he translated Virgil's poem from the original Latin in 1697. Following Dryden, a number of writers composed traditional georgics that highlighted the virtues of British agriculture. These poems included John Philips' *The Cyder* (1708), William Somerville's *The Chace* (1735), Christopher Smart's *The Hop-Garden* (1752), and John Dyer's *The Fleece* (1757), all of which feature in Grainger's poem. In praising British agricultural goods, these georgics performed important cultural work, emphasizing Britain's natural resources, as well as the commercial power the nation wielded in trading these goods across the globe. 

Although *The Sugar-Cane* was published relatively late in the georgic revival, Grainger's decision to write the poem as a georgic makes a decisive statement about his ambitions: he wanted to establish himself as a great writer able to follow in the footsteps of classical figures like Virgil. Additionally, he wanted to underscore the importance of the Caribbean colonies to the British Empire, the overall strength of which he also sought to emphasize. At the same time, the poem had to address one obvious difference between *The Sugar-Cane* and its predecessors: St. Kitts, the setting of *The Sugar-Cane* and Grainger's new home, was not Britain. Moreover, sugarcane was not a British plant. Indeed, most of the tropical plants found in the Caribbean were unfamiliar to British readers, as was the process of sugar production. Grainger addresses these issues directly in his preface and tries to turn them to his advantage. First, he explains that the Caribbean landscape is so novel and beautiful that it cannot help but "enrich poetry with many new and picturesque images" (v). Second, he claims that he will use the poem to introduce British readers to new words and concepts, particularly by providing extensive notes that would effectively act as a natural history or account of Caribbean nature. Aware that the addition of notes and scientific information could open him up to criticism from poetic traditionalists, Grainger coined the term "West-India georgic" to describe his hybrid work and asked that his readers consider him "a physician, and not a poet" (vii) when he veered too much into botany and medicine.


## How Does Grainger Depict Slavery in *The Sugar-Cane*?

In writing *The Sugar-Cane*, however, Grainger faced yet another and even more difficult challenge that he arguably failed to solve. On the one hand, the georgic traditionally emphasized the healthful benefits of labor. It also sought to demonstrate that a nation's power and liberty were rooted in its commerce. On the other hand, the eighteenth-century production of sugar--and the strength and prosperity of the British Empire--depended centrally on enslaved labor. As such, Grainger adopted various strateiges, sometimes contradictory, for dealing with the paradoxical task of depicting enslavement as a beneficial and desirable state.

For one, Grainger chose to use classical, georgic vocabulary to describe enslaved laborers. Two terms that appear frequently are "swain" and "hind," both of which were used in other georgics to describe shepherds and agricultural workers. Grainger also used his poem to advocate for what came to be known as amelioration. Ameliorationists like Grainger believed that, if enslavers treated the enslaved "humanely," then the practice could be both profitable to enslavers and pleasant for the enslaved. This belief is clearly an abhorrent position, and it was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to counter the rising popularity of the abolitionist movement and to perpetuate plantation slavery. 

It is not necessarily surprising that Grainger would have taken on an ameliorationist position: he married into a family of enslavers and hoped to profit from the system of plantation slavery himself. Nevertheless, there are moments in the poem when the cruelties of life on the plantation become too great for Grainger to ignore or cover over with aestheticized language. Indeed, one could even argue that, in these moments, Grainger's attempts at aestheticization inadvertently highlight the paradoxes in his position and the impossibility of portraying slavery in a positive light. For example, in one passage of the poem that describes the milling of cane, which was crushed between large steel rollers to extract the sugar-filled juice inside, Grainger writes,

> AND now thy mills dance eager in the gale;  
> Feed well their eagerness: but O beware;  
> Nor trust, between the steel-cas’d cylinders,  
> The hand incautious: off the member snapt  
> Thou’lt ever rue; sad spectacle of woe! (IV.165-169)  
{:.indented}

Although Grainger tries to emphasize the "eagerness" of the mills to process the sugar and thereby avoid discussion of the coerced and unwilling human beings who were feeding cane into the mills, he is forced by the dangerousness of milling to acknowledge both the participation of human beings and the possibility of serious harm. Because the cane had to be put into the steel rollers by hand, workers often would catch body parts between them, and even Grainger must admit that these occurrences constituted "sad spectacle[s] of woe."[^fn1]

There are other moments that similarly draw attention to themselves for their incongruity, and some of these were even criticized by Grainger's contemporaries as glossing over the harsh realities of slavery in a too insensitive or unfeeling manner. For example, in a review of *The Sugar-Cane* for the *Critical Review*, Grainger's friend Johnson largely praised the poem but complained about the following passage:

> Clear roll their ample eye; their tongue be red;  
> Broad swell their chest; their shoulders wide expand;  
> Not prominent their belly; clean and strong  
> Their thighs and legs, in just proportion rise. (IV.74-77)  
{:.indented}

In these lines, Grainger turned to the subject of examining African captives newly arrived in the Caribbean and determining their healthfulness and suitability for plantation labor. It was, in fact, common practice for enslavers to perform the kind of physical inspection Grainger describes, but Johnson was nevertheless disturbed by these lines and wrote in response, "[H]ere we think that tenderness and humanity, with which the former part of the poem seems replete, is, in some measure, forgotten. The poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation; but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for chusing an horse” (277). Johnson does not condemn Grainger completely and even seems to endorse his ameliorationist agenda by praising his "tenderness and humanity" in earlier parts of the poem, but he also calls the slave trade an "ungenerous commerce" and objects to Grainger's implicit equation of the enslaved with animals or mere objects. 

Indeed, although Grainger's ameliorationist and other pro-slavery positions were shared by many of his contemporaries, abolitionist ideas became increasingly prevalent and popular in the years immediately following the publication of *The Sugar-Cane*. In 1772, *Somerset v. Stewart* (also known as the Somerset ruling) made it illegal for enslaved persons in England to be seized and detained in preparation for deportation and sale outside the country. Although this decision did not formally abolish slavery in England, it was understood by many to have done so in practice. Then, in 1773, Phillis Wheatley's *Poems on Various Subjects* was published and catalyzed public debate over the equality, treatment, and status of the enslaved. Also, in 1775, Anthony Benezet founded the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage, an abolitionist organization based in Philadelphia. 

Grainger himself even veers into abolitionism for one brief interlude. This interlude comes in Book IV, when the narrator wishes that poetry could grant freedom to all:

> OH, did the tender muse possess the power,
> Which monarchs have, and monarchs oft abuse:
> ‘Twould be the fond ambition of her soul,
> To quell tyrannic sway; knock off the chains [235]
> Of heart-debasing slavery; give to man,
> Of every colour and of every clime,
> Freedom, which stamps him image of his God. (232-238)
{:.indented}

Why Grainger would include these lines in a work defending slavery is worth asking. To what extent did the conflict between the sentiments of the classical georgic and the realities of eighteenth-century slavery create tension and paradox in his poetry? Are there other signs of ambivalence, doubt, or dissent in *The Sugar-Cane*? Can we read for those signs, and can we even possibly use the poem as a source for information and knowledge about the plantation that would undermine Grainger's intention of validating it? 


## Why a Digital Edition? 

The above questions are some of the ones that we hope readers of this edition will be prompted to consider. We also want readers to be able to formulate their own questions and ways of reading *The Sugar-Cane*. To that end, we made the decision to create a digital, versus print, edition of Grainger's work. 

There are already two modern versions of *The Sugar-Cane* available in print. One is John Gilmore' 1999 *Poetics of Empire*, a scholarly edition of *The Sugar-Cane* that contains a wealth of information about the poem and Grainger's sources. In fact, we sometimes relied on Gilmore's footnotes to supplement the gaps in our own and want to acknowledge that debt here. We also acknowledge it in individual footnotes that cite Gilmore where appropriate. There is also a version of the poem contained in Thomas W. Krise's 1999 *Caribbeana*, an excellent anthology of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writing about the Caribbean. Krise's anthology is actually similar to our edition in spirit, as both are designed for potential use in the classroom. 

Our edition differs from Krise and Gilmore's works, however, in that we take advantage of the flexibility of a digital platform to provide readers with multiple versions of the poem. These versions include:

> A "full text" version  
> A "page by page" version  
> Excerpts from the poem focused on specific themes and grouped under the rubric of the "counter-plantation"  
{:.indented}

What we are calling the "full text" version contains all of the pages of the poem on one webpage. In other words, readers can scroll through the entire poem without ever clicking away from it and thereby enjoy a continuous reading experience. This version of the poem also facilitates keyword searches within the whole poem. To see all the uses of a particular word in the poem, readers can use the "Find" command included in their web browsers or the "Search" function included on our site's sidebar. This version of the poem also facilitates printing: if readers wish to print or save a copy of the poem for consultation offline, we recommend first using the web browser's "Print" command to create a PDF of the full text version and then printing or saving the PDF. 

The "page by page" version of the poem allows the reader to click through the poem page by page. Our pages and page breaks strictly follow Grainger's and provide the reader with an experience analagous to reading the 1764, London first edition, which we used as the basis for our own. We also have included a link to images of the pages from the 1764 edition for those readers who wish to compare our transcription with the original. The images were photographed from a copy of the 1764 edition owned by Cristobal Silva, one of the editors of this project.

The excerpts constitute a final version (or versions) of the poem. Grouped under "The Counter-Plantation" on the home page, these excerpts consist of groups of passages from the poem focused around certain themes, including indigenous presence and obeah. They also include short essays or headnotes prefacing each group of passages to provide key background information and guiding questions to readers.  

In terms of deciding what topics to focus on in our counter-plantation excerpts, we chose ones that would highlight Grainger's brief, yet undeniably present, discussions of enslaved persistence and resistance under slavery. In other words, the goal of these excerpts is to enable counter-plantation readings of the poem. First used by Yvonne Acosta and Jean Casimir, the term counter-plantation describes those elements of the Caribbean plantation system that helped the formerly enslaved become independent cultivators after emancipation. These elements included provision grounds, which the enslaved used to grow food crops for their own survival (see our excerpt on "Provision Grounds" for more information). In the spirit of Saidiya Hartman's call for scholars to create "counter-histories of slavery," however, we also include within our counter-plantation section excerpts on themes that we believe will push readers to challenge Grainger's narrative of imperial prosperity and formulate "counter-readings" of the poem (4).[^fn2] Our hope is that these excerpts might inspire a willingness not only to read the poem creatively but also to re-arrange it and bring the everyday lives of the enslaved and other marginalized subjects of the plantation to the foreground of analysis. 

Indeed, the image we have included at the top of our homepage is an original work of art by Vanessa Lee, who was kind enough to enter into our project of encouraging readers to "break" *The Sugar-Cane* and read it for their own interests and purposes. The piece of cane in Lee's image is a reproduction of the sugarcane illustration that was included in the 1764 edition of *The Sugar-Cane*, although, in the case of the 1764 edition, the stalk was whole and not broken (see the frontispiece of *The Sugar-Cane* for comparison).[^fn3] Lee's illustration also includes a rat to reference one of the most well-known, if probably untrue, stories about critical reaction to *The Sugar-Cane*. In his *Life of Johnson*, James Boswell recalls a reading of a manuscript draft of *The Sugar-Cane* that took place at the London home of the eighteenth-century painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The line, “Now, Muse, let’s sing of rats,” is supposed to have caused the audience to burst into laughter. In response, Grainger deleted the word “rats” from the poem and replaced it with “whisker’d vermine-race,” but the fact is that Grainger's work contains harsh realities that ultimately cannot be papered over with poetic language (II.62).[^fn4] We would ask readers to keep these realities in mind and to avoid treating Grainger as an author or authority who needs to be revered. A little laughter may, in fact, be in order. 


## Notes on Transcription and Language

In creating this edition, we have striven to produce a "semidiplomatic" edition that faithfully reproduces all the important features of the 1764 edition (Driscoll 254). As such, we made no changes or corrections to Grainger's words or spelling. We also largely reproduced the punctuation from the 1764 edition. Nevertheless, because we wanted to produce a readable edition of the work that would be accessible to eighteenth-century specialists and non-specialists alike, we did make the following changes to the text:

> We modernized any uses of the 'long s'
> We substituted standard capital letters for any large, small, or otherwise irregular capital letters
> We did not replicate ligatures between letters 
> We eliminated any extra spaces in front of punctuation marks 
> We did not maintain Grainger's practice of indenting each new stanza of poetry and each of his footnotes
> We indented and centered text only when not doing so would impair readability (i.e., text on title pages is uncentered)
> We did not replicate the headers on each page that repeated the book number and title of the work
> We did not replicate printer's marks in the footers of pages
> We did not maintain the eighteenth-century practice of repeating the first word of a page on at the bottom of the previous page. This practice was followed in the eighteenth century because it was thought to improve readability, but it is no longer conventional to follow it today. 
{:.indented}

Finally, Grainger and other eighteenth-century writers often were inconsistent in their use of terms to describe peoples and places. They also used terms for Caribbean colonization and slavery that are no longer considered by many scholars to be accurate or representative. As a result, we have made an effort to use the following terms, versus Grainger's, in our own commentary and footnotes on *The Sugar-Cane*: 

> "African" for people born in Africa  
> "Afro-Caribbean" for those established in the Caribbean  
> "British" (or Scottish or English or Welsh) for people born in Britain  
> "Caribbean" for "West Indies"  
> "Creole" for any non-indigenous person born in the Caribbean  
> "Enslaved person" rather than "slave"  
> "Fugitive" rather than "runaway slave"  
> "Indigenous" for "native" peoples  
> "St. Kitts" for "St. Christopher"
